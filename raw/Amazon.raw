does this company only sell their product on amazon? if not, what about purchases made in other stores?

is there a backstory as to why op was cruising toilet paper reviews on amazon? i bet it is awesome.

people buy something in a store (possibly a great quantity of something over time), dislike it, and use their amazon account to complain about it.  happens to almost every product review i read.  sellers know this, but can either ask about the problem, or use the "you just bought one" callout as an easy refutation.  delisting/relisting the product to destroy all the old reviews helps as well.

theres no evidence here at all. the toilet paper could be available at stores, started using it, bought more on amazon when they ran out, septic system is now screwed.

why would you buy toilet paper on amazon? genuinely curious.

i guess the manufacturer and everyone here is assuming the brand can only be purchased at amazon.  theres zero possibility the poster had bought it elsewhere for a while, saw it later at amazon, bought it there and then the septic tank went to hell?dont get me wrong, i dont know the poster nor the tp but all the bashing assumes that one time purchase is the only time/place they could have bought it.

... except she may have been buying the tp from a store for months before buying it on amazon. i didnt even know amazon/amazon third party sellers sold toilet paper.interestingly the guy never addresses the claim that their tp is septic-safe.

isnt it possible she bought this in the store and then was going to order more of it on amazon?

so im not the only one considering buying tp on amazon now, right??

holy shit, you can buy 400,000 acres of the amazon for just 14m? no wonder theyre logging the shit out of it, thats cheap. theres single family houses that cost more than that.

this probably wont be seen, but in 2008 he was fined 137 million for illegally cutting down the same rainforest. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2087169/johan-eliasch-gordon-brown-consultant-fined-for-illegal-amazon-logging.html

yes and then he started [cutting it down himself](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2087169/johan-eliasch-gordon-brown-consultant-fined-for-illegal-amazon-logging.html)
27
years from now he will be selling pure bottled amazonian air.  genius.

thats awesome. it really is, but the majority of land being deforested in the amazon rainforest is actually used for grazing land for cattle. that seems to be a common misconception in this thread.

this newspaper says otherwise http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2087169/johan-eliasch-gordon-brown-consultant-fined-for-illegal-amazon-logging.html

this was 2006.2008: http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-06-07/news/28474666_1_amazon-folha-de-sao-paulo-landwhat a shitty til.

are there any taxes?could i get some prices per acre of amazon rainforest?
2
sad that amazon rain forest can be purchased for 35 an acre. i should throw my spare change at slowly buying up the amazon.
2
so. if the amazonian rainforest is 670.000.000 acres large. that means at a price of 35, it would cost 23.450.000.000. thats a fifth of facebook market cap. interesting!
2
allow me to break the news: the loggers will log the shit out of that land (if they havent already), being he or not the legal owner of the land. there is simply no enforcement in the amazon. thats just the ways things are in brazil.
2
wait, amazon owned a rain forest?

swedish tycoons firm fined  275 mn for logging in amazonhttp://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-06-07/news/28474666_1_amazon-folha-de-sao-paulo-land

we need quick action to save the amazon rainforest. if we do not save it, humanity is doomed
1
why dont we buy the rest of the amazon and call it even?
1
wait, thats like 35 an acre? how the hell is that fucking possible? can i buy amazon rainforest for 35 an acre???
1
the real problem isnt as much owning the land its protecting it.  illegal logging happens all the time and the loggers know they dont own the land - be it federal land or private.  this happens all over the place in brazil - im sure its a problem in the other countries that make up the amazon forest as well.i do love the effort though - now if he can keep it!
1
what a sucker!  when i was in first grade i bought an acre of the amazon for 1!  wonder what its worth now

thats nice and all but isnt a lot (a lot) of logging in the amazon illegal anyway? sure, its incredibly admirable but isnt it ultimately futile private individuals doing this? honest question.
1
we should totally get someone like warren buffet or the bill and melinda gates foundation to get on board with this. imagine how much of the forest they could save. as someone already stated, this guy bought it for 35 an acre. to theoretically buy the entire amazon at that price, it would cost you about 59.5 billion. obviously this is unrealistic, but imagine. bill and melinda has an endowment of about 38.3 billion, so theoretically they could buy about 1 billion acres. again, while this unrealistic, they do have that kind of buying ability. lets say they spent about 10 billion dollars, which still leaves a lot of money for other charities. that would get them 285 million acres, about 1/6 of the rainforest. where you at /u/thisisbillgates?
1
so when i read this initially i thought it meant amazon as in the website.
1
the amazon rainforest alone is 14.5 million acres. so this is not going to be cheap. now imagine a big russian investor buying huge areas of, lets say the tongas national forest in alaska. imagine the outrage! though the idea might be great. we in the western world are the main reason those forests are getting cut down. if we want to preserve them we got to change our ways of living. which is pretty unlikely to happen. more efficiency, less consumption of energy and resources in general and doing without a lot of comforts we are used to and dont even recognize as luxurys anymore.i guess we are fucked. oh no wait a minute those or bastard s in the south are fucked. invest in fencing manufactures now !!!!

there are 1.7bil acres in amazon, he bought 400kwell i guess hes still generous
1
400,000 acres sounds like a lot, doesnt it? sure it does, but 400,000 acres roughly only 625 sq. miles. the amazon rainforest is >2 million sq. miles.

amazon, netflix, google, etc. are coming together to decide the best way to monetize a universal video format. this will mean more ads, less user driven content and more commercial influence in programming. we will be back to the standard we left behind years ago with networks.
2
amazon, netflix, google, microsoft, mozilla and others partner to create next-gen video format - its not often we see these rival companies come together to build a new technology together, but the members argue that this kind of alliance is necessary to create a new interoperable video standard that they can control.there fixed it
2
so.....something something drm. pretty sure. i mean why else? amazon prime, google video, mozilla god knows why but netflix for sure. so ething thats streamline, multiplatform, comunicates with the major players, prevents access via proxy, tracks users, doesnt allow to be easily copied without permission. all whilst inproving compression so bandwidth isnt hampered too much. plus and a huge bunch of minuses.
2
i hope amazon comes to it. since theyre so fucking petty with google and wont support chromecast, im stuck using the computer to cast it, which means i then have to remote desktop in to control it, and the quality suffers badly.

amazon would be amazing!

subscription based streaming video services really need a common protocol so anyone can integrate with them.theres no reason hulu, netflix and amazon video couldnt be accessed in the same app that any developer could right if those companies could agree upon a standard for access.hoping we eventually get there and i can just add login credentials for my services and not be locked into their individuals apps. and then nintendo could even develop their own app for it.

i use my wii u to stream everything my family watches.  im wanting to sell my wii u and upgrade to a switch, but right now, that would actually be a downgrade. if my wii u broke today, i would walk past the switches and go buy another wii u, because its the only console nintendo currently has with modern functionality.nintendo wanted the *focus* to be on gaming?  the switch has fewer games and less hardware than any other current gen console.  without other apps, the switch is *only* for gaming.  if im going to buy something just for gaming, why would it be the switch?  why would i not buy a console that does games better and has the ability to stream?i dont buy nintendo consoles to have the best gaming experience.  i buy nintendo consoles to play exclusives and to have a multimedia device that plays netflix, amazon, and hulu.

ok reggie, heres the list i need;* netflix* spotify* youtube* twitch* amazon prime* ziggo gothank you.
2
give me netflix and crunchyroll please! (ok maybe amazon video).  ^_^

this story shows that nintendo was never ready to release the switch. streaming services for the switchs architecture should take no time to produce. netflix, hulu, and amazon could have given such responsibility to their interns, who would had have the software ready for launch. as more and more details about the switch are revealed, it shows that nintendo released the console to make a quick buck and to scope their current audience.
1
i think nintendo has really screwed the pooch on this launch. streaming today is such a mainstay for kids and adults. in many ways it maybe their only form of video entertainment outside of youtube. what should they get on one of their other game consoles to stream netflix, amazon, hulu, or youtube. throw in the hardware issues they are having and this could be a big old turd of a flop for nintendo.

netflix, hulu, and amazon streaming make nintendo no money.  **gee**, why arent they focusing on those?......
0
i dont own a switch and dont intend to, but why does netflix/amazon need to be on everything? its on cell phones, tablets, built in to tvs, other consoles, bluray players, etc.odds that the nintendo switch would be someones only method to watch netflix is pretty slim these days, and even then, on the move in a car, train, etc, they might not have wifi anyway, so a cell phone (with a higher resolution screen, btw) might be the preferred streaming device.

i have like 30 devices with netflix and amazon.  id rather they focus on games.
