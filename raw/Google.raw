this is googles bid to diversify and grow into a ge-like entity.

for anyone curious why google would do this, page has said that they do not plan on having alphabet as its own brand. given that the google brand is worth over 65 billion (http://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list/), there are no plans to rebrand any core google products. this new structure is to allow the development of new brands to grow and thrive, alongside the core google business. for example, businesses like the google x projects, nest, calico, etc, can now grow more independently of google, and have a more focused approach. sundar pichai will continue to grow the core business, and the other ceos under larry page can focus on developing the moonshots/smaller businesses...like google fiber, nest, project wing, project loon, etc. from a management perspective, this move makes a lot of sense.

googling the word alphabet, will be about as useful as googling the word google.
509
to reiterate a point the article is (intentionally?) vague about: **they are not re-branding google.com or any core google products** you will not go to alphabet.com or abc.xyz or any other url to search, its not going to be alphabet chrome or abc docs or any such nonsense. doing that would be absolutely ridiculous. google has reached a level of brand pervasiveness marketing pros would sell their soul for. google is *literally* synonymous with searching, when your brand name is so ingrained in a culture your name can be used interchangeably with what your product is you have achieved maximum brand potential. renaming the google domain would be possibly the dumbest business decision ever made by anyone ever. so yeah, its not happening.

nice try google, im still not going to use alphabet plus

google is set on world dominationnow what will your children think of when they learn of "the alphabet" in school?im onto you googletime to go clean my tinfoil hat.

[this](http://i.imgur.com/vgxs8fp.gif) is what google will soon become, so it was foretold by the wallaby.edit: fixed link

first off, this is a direct result of, and learning from, the google+ fiasco. they are essentially vowing to never let that happen again. googles name got dragged through mud because they tried to consolidate everything under one umbrella and that went badly, to say the least. secondly, this allows googles subsidiaries, such as nest, to make acquisitions of their own (e.g., nest acquired dropcam) without affecting the larger google brand. some are even saying that all of this was done to make sundar pichai stay and not leave to become the twitter ceo. i dont buy that as a key reason though it could be one of the many reasons.most importantly, imho, this is google preempting the market backlash against unchecked diversification...by itself and other major players i.e., facebook and apple. apple developing a car and facebook developing internet service providing ultralight planes....these things may make sense in todays market conditions, but once things turn, such diversification could very well back fire. by turning itself into a holding umbrella company, googles name is now free from self-driving cars, thermostats and various other ideas that may or may not be successful.it is a brilliant move by google.
317
itt: people who thinks google is being renamed alphabet.
111
the legal run around they have to do for this is interesting. as outlined in their form 8-k submitted to the us securities and exchange commission (http://www.sec.gov/archives/edgar/data/1288776/000128877615000039/a20150810form8-k.htm), google created a wholly owned subsidiary under itself called alphabet, and then alphabet will create a temporary wholly owned subsidiary under itself later this year (which is indirectly owned by google), and then they do a merger between google and this temporary subsidiary under alphabet so google ends up as a wholly owned subsidiary of alphabet and not the other way around. lawyers must be having fun.
16
>"googles health efforts like life sciences and calico, a division investigating aging and other diseases ..."-"investigating aging and other diseases"-aging and other diseases. -we were born infected
6
this is a good move, in my uneducated opinion. google can focus on their current projects instead of being directly involved with their experimental acquisitions (like calico, the self driving car, etc.).
33
alphabit would have made so much more sense for an omnipotent tech company. i mean come on, youve already got the misspelled googol-thing working for you. i expected more, google.
19
its like in ck2, where you create an empire title to help keep your realm organized. google is still the biggest kingdom in the empire of alphabet, but now the smaller kingdom of youtube, android, chrome, and so on can have their own kings to help manage the growing empire.
4
this is a gamble that google isnt quite ready to make.its an alpha bet.
6
this structure provides immunity to google brand when self driving cars start to drive up unemployment.
6
alphabet just doesnt have the same cachet as google.
48
abc.xyz?sorry, google, but i think a-to-z is already a common slogan/namesake of another gargantuan web company, amazon...
25
im sure they want to diversify and represent more than just a search engine.  so theyll start different subdivisions. one for every letter in the alphabet.  g  would obviously be for google, r for robotics, c for cars, f for fiber and so on until they use up all 26 letters.  then theyll reorganize into a new company called unicode.
4
i for one welcome our new google alphabet overlords.
4
the wording in the article is somewhat misleading.google is not renaming itself to alphabet. it is just separating lots of different things that google does into more independent companies, all underneath alphabet. so google is still here, well still be googling stuff, not alphabetting it. google will now just refer to the core internet part of the company, i.e. search, gmail, etc., while other projects like self driving cars and whatnot will be part of the larger umbrella in alphabet.source: i work at google.

eli5: is google good or bad?

google should rename to googleplex because it has exponentially grown since its beginning.

just today alphabet, parent company of google and many other high-tech ventures, was acquired by north central positronics, the technical arm of the sombra corporation...
3
can we not rebrand to the generic fucking terms on the planet? christ who the fuck even makes these decisions? i mean nobody is ever going to mistake google for anything else.
3
i understand that this is a measure to distance the google brand with their other projects and ideas. but ill get my tinfoil hat anyways.
2
google cant be evil, but now alphabet can be, if thats profitable.
2
this allows them to be evil without breaking their [dont be evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/don%27t_be_evil) slogan under the google name.
2
google is fucking crazy man. theyll probably own everything soon.
2
did anyone else notice that this also breaks from their [material design] (https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) docs as well? interesting to see that they consider this new enterprise a google rule-breaking take on things. and as such this now allows them to be evil, right??? hehe..
2
so they are making a folder in c drive named alphabet and putting their google folder in it?
2
their biggest mistake was telling us. now we know our personal information cant be trusted by this new company. you cant fool us google.
2
so is google going to continue being a search engine then?
2
im guessing that the team inside google responsible for trademark protection needed a bigger challenge
2
please no. i like the name "google" .
2
i first read google as a verb. i couldnt figure out why we should reorganize the alphabet.
2
first sentance:>google is dead.the second to last sentance:>the new company, alphabet, will preside over a collection of companies, the largest of which will be google...
2
does this mean that in future we wont "google" things but instead well abcdefghijklmn0pqrstuvwxyz things?
2
65 years from now..."i remember when our overlord alphabet used to be called google..."
2
i wonder if this means i can invest specifically in subsections of their business rather than in google stock overall.  i also wonder what this will do to their core stock.

i currently own google stock, tomorrow, will i still own google stock? or will i own alphabet stock?  if half of my stocks holdings are now held by a parent company, that seems like ive just been screwed?
1
i bet all of this stemmed from the colossal fuck up that was google glass. now more future fuckups wont be called "google fuck up x" and be associated with the brand.
1
i was about to complain about the new name "alphabet" as being really lame and silly.then i thought a second about "google", which nonetheless became a very popular household name and even computing term.and i have nothing left to say.
1
its smart because people will be less likely to day google owns everything.  now it will just be google.
1
google is now so rich they own the alphabet.

google getting ready to diversify get ready folks
1
does this mean that android will be a separate entity too? or is it still under google?
1
okay, but we get to rename the alphabet, the google.
1
i understand that it helps to compartmentalize different sectors so if they hit bad time it doesnt influence the other parts of google,  but doesnt that also mean those other sectors dont have as big of a fall back so they can get out of the slump to achieve greatness. kind of like seeing them free to fly or fall?
1
seems awfully bold to distance yourself from your own brand name that has become so ubiquitous that its an actual word.  but then..if i was as smart as them id have google money.
1
about time.  google  with do many diverse  interests, you cant just park it under the google the search company

larry: till now, weve just 6 of it.sergey: ok, lets have all the 26 of it.(just) a for apple, the whole alphabet for google.

will it still be called google?

i wonder if the company is having an identity crisis like some group we know about. trying to make something abnormal, seem normal, like how google is trying to idk cover its tracks by changing the name of the company. seems shady.

google -> alphabet -> skynet !

think of this move as the polar opposite of google+. it makes a lot of sense.

okay, why is this on this subreddit? hes not a refugee, a quick google shows his family emigrated from the ussr, peacefully without issue.

does google pay their taxes?
1
anyone else find the irony of trump supporters who say "buy american!", then support a man who has none of his very own clothing line made in the us.  but these same folks will boycott companies like apple, google, facebook, and tesla because theyre "liberal"?  i think they should change their rallying cry from "buy american" and just say "buy conservative".
1
i have never understood the adamant fighting against globalism that many people support. many of them would argue that brin (and google in general) are a curse that ruins the us with their focus on hiring from a global pool etc. imo there should be a larger focus on preparing americans for the higher skill-requirement and not a focus on shutting down any attempts at bringing in workers with more skill. not that betsy deturbocuck is going to help that...

he still looks stupid wearing the google glass though...

i really agree but if you want a good pic of him dont do one with google glasses

how about instead we tell sergey to fix their fucking algorithms so every google search on anyone even slightly left leaning doesnt have half a dozen breitbart fascist propaganda smears as the top results?

redd.it links dont work for google, and in general this stuff doesnt work well, but we can still circlejerk if you want. im all for it.

ah yes google, the company that doesnt pay taxes just like amazon and the rest of these leech companies taking public money from the government bail outs and putting it into private pockets.

like others have said, 0.1 (whether kilo*bytes* or kilo*bits*) is essentially not connected. nothing would load. when i lived on a farm we had a dialup connection that ran at 14kbps on a good day, and that would take a few minutes to load anything more complex than google

didnt google threaten denial of service to washington dc if sopa passed back in the day? i always liked the sound of that, "pass this idiocy and lose access to our search engine."

op, you are a silly silly little boy if you think that any of these sites that works with the government would bite the hand that helps feed most of them. especially google, microsoft, apple, twitter, and facebook.

amazon, netflix, google, etc. are coming together to decide the best way to monetize a universal video format. this will mean more ads, less user driven content and more commercial influence in programming. we will be back to the standard we left behind years ago with networks.
2
amazon, netflix, google, microsoft, mozilla and others partner to create next-gen video format - its not often we see these rival companies come together to build a new technology together, but the members argue that this kind of alliance is necessary to create a new interoperable video standard that they can control.there fixed it
2
so.....something something drm. pretty sure. i mean why else? amazon prime, google video, mozilla god knows why but netflix for sure. so ething thats streamline, multiplatform, comunicates with the major players, prevents access via proxy, tracks users, doesnt allow to be easily copied without permission. all whilst inproving compression so bandwidth isnt hampered too much. plus and a huge bunch of minuses.
2
theyll fuck this up. it will be vr using google glass that transmits every barcode, label and printed text it can detect in your background  to better serve you with ads during your gaming experience.
6
except there is some sly shit going on here, and its not really as "wonderful" as everyone thinks.they are cooperating on what the next-gen format will be, sure. but then every single one of them will do their own unique implementation of support for the format, as a blind, closed-source project. all these implementations will compete and clash, in **exactly** the same way that all of the platforms currently clash. want to watch hbo go in linux? not going to happen. want to use chrome in windows? youll need to uninstall the ms codec and install a special one from google. and so forth.and then theres always the performance jumble, too. one corp can make a decoder optimized for low bit rates, and claim it outperforms everyone else. quality falls by the wayside as a number race emerges. i mean, as raspberry pi board can "play" 1080p video ... if you have the right version of gstreamer, and the right kernel, and the video is encoded in a specific way, and isnt at too high a bitrate.and, of course, this fractured implementation space just leave an entire side channel for content platforms to operate with. non-compliant meta-data. encapsulation and stegonography. implicit licenses and eulas on content. googles codec will only work in chrome, and require a google login. ms codec will only work if you are logged into windows with a live account.this is going to get worse before it gets any better.
3
> that they have formed a new open source alliance  the alliance for open media  with the goal of developing the next generation of royalty-free video formats, codecs and other related technologies.why not work with the alliance we already have, and has proven to build rock solid codecs. xiph.org it is sad these companies are sooo arrogate conceited they can not simply to support the people already doing it.  they have the "not invented here" mentalityfrom the mozilla annoucement looks like daala will be part of this.  https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/09/01/forging-an-alliance-for-royalty-free-video/hopefully mozilla can put up a strong fight for user freedom and now allow the intel/microsoft/cisco/google beast to infect the project with user controls and violate the spirit of open source.
3
google + microsoft.. if they fully start cooperating about this.... gg, mpeg consortium.both have extensive video codec knowledge and brainpower, and microsoft research is frankly scary. the rest of the companies are just bonuses.

bandwidth is an ever pressing issue for video streaming. as we have switched from broadcast television to modern streaming, we need more effective methods of getting that information from its source to its many destinations. old style broadcasts generally scaled well, requiring minimal effort to accommodate more viewers. it was simply the same data being sent everywhere in a vicinity. this also limited the available selection of content. the internet has changed that model. while there are still some optimizations like locally caching of video/data, it does not scale as well as the old-style broadcast. a newer/better/more compatible format could benefit all of these companies due to various "throttling" techniques that internet companies use. some countries (im thinking of australia) has or had metered internet where people pay by data used. a single format would ensure that steaming devices, smart phones, etc. all have proper hardware to deliver proper performance without draining the battery too much.even if high-speed internet access were considered a basic necessity, the current internet backbone is insufficient for the growing demand. three, non-exclusive, options include: be more efficient, hence a new format and new internet transmission protocols; newer / more hardware for the internet backbone, like how google is laying new fiber; and throttling/rationing (what we all hope to avoid).edit: i mentioned new internet transmission protocols, but im unaware of any specifics. im aware of an older broadcast protocol, but it wouldnt work well with how the internet works now. perhaps a psuedo-broadcast protocol designed to minimize redundant data being sent, perhaps at the cost of latency, may be something researchers will/have looked into as well.
1
no matter what they decide, if you just use chrome it will work fine. google may collect as much data as it can about you, but they do make a damn good browser that will load pretty much anything you throw at it.
1
>there is no dearth of royalty-free next-gen codec projects, of course. mozilla has daala, cisco has thor, and google is working on vp9 and 10. its no surprise then that the alliances first project is to create a new video codec specification thats based on the previous work of its members.and there you have it. everyone with their own interests. at least the mpeg-la has a unified standard, like mpeg-4 (aka: divx4), mpeg-4/asp (aka: xvid) and mpeg-4 part 10 (aka: h.264, avc).theres a reason standards from groups like the mpeg-la and smpte have stood the test of time.
1
you have to wonder how something like this starts. did google just suddenly walk up to microsoft and others saying "hey, want to make a new video codec?".

im hoping for google to create an android phone all by themselves instead of relying on lg and other manufacturers. i love android, but the software updates are really bugging me.

its a sign of the times but tech companies that arent capital and labor intensive like google, facebook and apple are valued more than the industrial giants (oil companies, ge, honeywell etc.) with all their equipment and machinery.
28
apple net income - 18.361 billiongoogle net income - 4.675 billionapple p/e - 10.26google p/e - 31.70dont understand why people in here are acting like apple is about to go bankrupt.
44
i for one accept our new google overlords.
148
the biggest difference in terms of innovation between the two is that google likes to announce their projects whereas apple is more secretive
39
lets be honest here. google has been the most valuable company ever since they aquired search engine monopoly.advertising, data collection, fibre connections, satellites, cameras, autonomous cars, ai systems, glasses, vr technologies... google is taking over the world. period.
10
alphabet is more valuable than apple. google is now only a small piece of a very big, delicious, pie.
2
i care not for either company. my android is rooted and i havent used google for 9 months. there are other alternatives. more privacy conscious alternatives.
2
more like apple has lost so much value, as a company, that its brought down to the level of google.
2
congratulation google! continue doing good work and please; bring google fiber to michigan!! thank you!
2
i didnt, and dont think apple will remain at the top for too long. my reasoning for this is that they rely too heavily on iphones and the like. while google is much more diverse in where they get their revenue.
2
google = alphabet? doesnt alphabet own other things?
2
inevitable really. apple sells products, google sells its users. you cant complete with that kind of digital slavery. at least your corporeal body has rights and protections.. your digital one has none.
5
makes sense. alphabet is expanding its own isp (google fiber) while apple is spray painting smart watches gold.
2
google innovates.  they create.  theyre forward-thinking and theyre fighting to continuously top themselves.apple was that way.  but after jobs died, they decided to rest on their laurels.  their only innovations have been ways to squeeze more money out of their customers.  its a shame really, as i own so many apple products.  it was like the company died with jobs.
-5
apples turn over 121 billion. googles is 60 billion give or take. samsung 600 billion...
2
google is more about power anyway. no company matches them in power. they can make millionaires overnight, they can make whole companies or destroy whole companies. they can make you a celebrity. make no mistake about it. they may not be the most valuable company, they may not have the highest revenue, but they hold the most power. tywin wasnt king but that he sure enough had the real power.
2
not a surprise really.  googles portfolio is immense.  they are diversified into so many different industries now and each one is focusing on r&d and breaking new ground.  apple cant even begin to compare.
2
google wanting to be called alphabet is like when your sister, sara, comes home from college and insists everyone call her zara (pronounced *zah-rah*)
2
if google really nail the automated car, then theyll keep on going, whereas apple at the moment dont really seem to have anything to fall back on.although before the launch of the ipod and the iphone id have probably said the same thing about them.
2
i dont think this is right.  im going to go google it.
1
i thought they always have been more valuable than apple. i dont think people really understand that apple isnt worth that much when compared to google. its really like comparing apples to oranges.
1
what the heck? no one noticed how wrong the title is?  alphabet, the conglomerate, of which google is a part, is the most valuable company.   yes, a case can be made that as of now, it is still mostly google. but, it is the diversity and potential of alphabet that has caused such interest in the market.

technically googles parent company.

"the last time google was more valuable than apple was in february 2010."

this just happened? wow im out of the loop, i thought google was the king pin for the last 5-10 years.
1
alphabet inc. is larger than apple. google is just a subsidiary.
1
not google passes apple.  makes it sound like google went up  on market shares above apple.  apple went down on market share and below google.
1
i realize theres an objective metric to this someplace, but google has been far, far more valuable to me as a company than apple for pretty much...since 1998.
1
its all about diversification. google is in everything. apple has a small monopoly on the smartphone market that they are quickly losing. go google!!!
1
today is the first day apple fans will tell you being #1 isnt so important suddenly.its not so much the rest of us are happy for some evil giant corporation like google topping a list.the rest of us are happy because apple fanboys just had 85% of their pointless annnoying argument cut off at its knees in one news cycle.so suddenly, according to them, it seems being #1 isnt such a big deal anymore/google did it by being dirty/it doesnt count because of contexts xyz, etc.let the fanboy butthurt continue to flow as it scrambles to explain...*"why?"* and *"how?"*
1
google has always been more valuable then apple. the search engine alone has been more useful to the world then the iphone.
2
i like google more, which makes all knowledge available to everyone, rich or poor, and google invests in many other fields as well, like medicine, driveless ca.

if you want to know how google operates, read [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/eyewash-how-the-cia-deceives-its-own-workforce-about-operations/2016/01/31/c00f5a78-c53d-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html). sums up googles compartmentalized approach perfectly.

both apple and google are paying next to nothing in taxes. it might be a legal loophole but it is ethically wrong and morally wrong.

uhh nice.. but apple wont let me download google drive in my phone. smh

ill always be salty that my parents didnt listen to 12 year old me and sink all our money into google.  id be retired right now

this is just because apples future growth prospects are bleak while google has been averaging 13-14% growth
1
next step: get google fiber to everyone.
1
shit... does that mean that reddit is going to start hating google now?
1
the big take from this is that google has been steadily increasing in value, while apple dropped from 700bn to 500bn.very impressive on googles part, while a bit concerning for apple.
