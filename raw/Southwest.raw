i think southwest could just flash uniteds logo and just have their slogan over it "wanna get away?"
2650
i just realized that it flows better as "we beat the competition." welp.edit: [fixed.](http://i.imgur.com/tbhvxyy.png) better version.theres also a nonzero chance ill get a cease-and-desist letter from southwest.

im flying to costa rica in few months for my honeymoon.  all flights were 830 round trip per ticket.  looked at southwest but they didnt have a flight the day i was coming home.  however there was one the day after.  lo and behold, i extended my vacation an extra day and my price per ticket is only 325 round trip.  i have essentially saved hundreds of dollars by extending my honeymoon vacation thanks to southwest.  i owe this airline some lovin!

my experience with southwest has always been amazing. being a veteran, they always insist my drinks are free, even though only the first one is supposed to be. there was also this one time i expressed my fear of flying to our attendant, boris. he took out his tablet and gave it to me. he showed me the southwest app that displays the planes current position, weather condition, and flight path. he reassured me that everything is okay. boris, if you read this, thank you so much.

all of a sudden everyone is best friends with southwest
11
thank god for southwest.
31
oddly enough, southwest has a rate of involuntary denied boardings that is double united.  assume southwest just doesnt let them board in the first place though.
5
as i always say when booking tickets, "southwest is best"
14
southwest airlines:"cmon, we can get 10 of you to de-board for a free night at the motel and under 200 airplane cash."
9
i work for southwest. i approve. lol
3
southwest should run a "wanna get away" ad with uniteds pr rep doing a press conference.
5
"southwest airlines - we take the violence to the competition."
7
how much would southwest get in trouble if they made that an add?
3
ive always had great luck with alaskan, southwest, and virgin.  i think alaskan bought virgin though.
3
southwest - cheap and lousy but not abusive
5
i actually havent yet had a bad experience with southwest.
5
i have always had an average to good experience with southwest, despite their being a "discount" airline. plus, on my way home from kansas, i saw the most beautiful flight attendant of all time. i honestly had trouble not staring at her.
2
just booked my first ever flight like 3 days ago and chose southwest. couldnt be happier right now
2
lets not forget that southwest kicked kevin smith off a flight because he was considered too fat.
2
employees pull an 83,000-pound southwest airlines 737 half the length of a regulation football field at the fifteenth annual pigskin plane pull to celebrate the red river showdown between texas and oklahoma.

southwest is the best. hope they dont change
2
southwest has more involuntary removals than any airline. they overbook like crazy.
6
southwest. an airline that wont beat you up and kill you.
4
as someone who follows the airline industry a bit, southwest is genuinely impressive, and i truly wish they served the routes i wanted to take.
4
and then southwest comes in with a cease and desist order, then posting this image on their twitter claiming ownership.

says them. fuck south west. i was arrested and beaten at the oakland airport cause i raised my voice (i was irate) when they told me my plane left already when i had text messages telling me my flight was leaving at a certain time. my flight kept getting delayed. showed up 20 minutes before the time to board and they told me the flight left. i work in customer service so i try to be a good customer if lack for any other reason than karma. but i asked them how it was possible my plane left early when its been delayed 3 times and i have been receiving updates by text. i told them that i need to be on the next available flight because i needed to be at my grandfathers funeral. they told me there was nothing i could and would need to take a flight the following day. i asked to speak to a manager and she called security. i had just come from the restaurant literally across the way and she must have smelled the beer i had with dinner and thought that was necessary. whatever. i just wanted to get on a flight to join my family. security came and told me that i could leave the airport but i could not fly out of there. so i tell them thats unacceptable, that i need to make my grandfathers service. i ask them what am i supposed to do? im a struggling student, and that im hundreds of miles from my car and from my destination. where am i supposed to go?thats when they called the police. the police proceeded to arrest me and sometime between that and getting put into the police car, i lose complete memory. i woke up with bruises and knots all over my face in a jail cell. spent 16 hours in there before my parents could drive all the way from la to california and bail me out. the prison proceeds to wait an additional 6 hours after i was bailed out to let me go. after which my parents took me to a hospital. i had a concussion and contusions and bruises all over my body. i hired a lawyer to represent me. she told me this sort of thing is not as uncommon as you would think. the case gets thrown out immediately before trial. im still paying off legal fees, hospital fees, and for my bail. it happened just about a year ago and im finally about to be completely paid off with parents for supporting me during one of the single worst experiences of my life. fuck traveling alone. fuck united. and fuck southwest. no customer should ever be treated like a criminal. there is a serious abuse of power and sickens me to see this happen to anyone. the lesson i learned is that you should never travel alone. never travel without someone who can watch your back and be a potential character witness. i wish i sued southwest simply to pay for the bills i incurred from that traveling experience. my whole thought process at that time was that i just wanted to be safe at home and i just wanted the experience to be over. no more lawyers. no more thinking about it. i just wanted to forget it ever happened. worst experience and worst feeling of my life. i hope something good comes to the doctor who was treated this way because its inhuman to treat anyone with that amount indecency and brute force. i hate the way seeing those videos made me feel. i just hope he is okay cause his experience looked far worse than mine.edit: i dont want attention from this. just seeing this meme pissed me off. its not just united. southwest is guilty of this too.

in a year southwest will buy united with the change they find in their seats

southwest is the only fullt wheelchair accessible airline too. so great.

such a richard branson move... well done southwest

southbysouthwestern airlines: we beat our competitors and we beat you off.

as someone who just got off a southwest flight.yup.
1
last time i was on a southwest flight, the march madness tournament was on. they charge like 5 for wifi but they also have free streaming of some tv channels, one of which was cbs. basketball the whole way home, free bag check, and i didnt get my face beat into the seat.
1
yeah, southwest is great, unless they think youre too fat. remember the time they kicked kevin smith off of a flight?
1
southwest should capitalize on this and give that doctor free flights. the publicity would be a goldmine.
1
southwest might be the least fancy company in terms of in flight tech and what not but dammit they get me from chicago to whenever the hell i wanna go without brain damage so im gonna stick to it
1
i was on an overbooked southwest flight one time and no one wanted to get off.  they started offering discounts on other flights and when it got to two roundtrip tickets to anywhere southwest flew several people volunteered to get off the flight.  the flight attendant pick a couple they got off the plane and took off, end of story.
1
i dont even live in america but i really like southwest. i went on a couple of flights with them the first time i was in america and to my complete surprise id earned enough miles for a free la to chicago flight that i used on my next trip. theyre not glamorous but they fly pretty much everywhere in america and their service including their in flight service is more than adequate. other good airlines are virgin and jetblue from my experience.
1
its funny because the two fatal accidents on southwest were death by blunt trauma.  one guy was beaten to death....
1
southwests new slogan: "were not united airlines".
1
funny, but fuck southwest. ive never had a flight with them that went as planned. every flight ive had with them they either lost my luggage or the plane was delayed. my last flight with them was a 3 part trip. first flight was delayed 5 hours, obviously i missed my second flight. they did not make it a priority to put me on another flight. fuck southwest, ill never willingly fly with them again.
1
speaking of southwest, i have a family member who has worked for them for about 15+ years.  she actually mentioned to me she understands why they had to remove the passangers but does admit it wasnt approached the best way."if something happened last minute that made them have to deadhead their crew, they had no choice. the flight was booked full but unfortunately, last minute situations suck. i have had to deal with this exact scenario before. 3 flight attendants on a 3 hour delayed flight that was completely full. after 3+ hours of these customers waiting around, i get told i need to get 2 volunteers (one of the fas could sit in the jumpseat) because we needed that crew positioned for the next morning because we didnt have a crew to work on the next flight out. if we didnt get them positioned, we may have had to severely delay several flights, or worse, start canceling. its a domino effect." its definitely a different perspective than youll get from a lot of media outlets.
1
i was racially profiled on a southwest flight in 2002.
1
ive had pretty shitty experiences with southwest. definitely gonna fly with them over united though.
1
dumb question is  this officially from southwest?
1
id like to know which font was used for the subtext.  also, i found a better quality southwest logo without the chopped off heart edge.  https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0aa4da_86af6b17667e4b8eba4dfc3955a310d0.pngp.s.  the subtext alteration "the competition" is truly better than "our competitors".  good choice.
1
this is just stupid. southwest had more paying passengers denied boarding than united during a study in 2014. https://i-kinja--img-com.cdn.ampproject.org/ii/w1200/s/i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--v6govl0l--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1371323988405560613.jpg

southwest only kicks you off if your skirt is too short.

plot twist: the security that threw the guy out were undercover agents of southwest.

southwest still sucks but...
1
dont know why but my experience with southwest is just gross upholstery
1
i was about to buy tickets from united to fly dfw to denver before i saw any of this today but decided to go with southwest instead, and i am highly satisfied i did now! :)
1
hahahahaha because that guy got beat on united, not southwest.too. rich.
1
i like southwest. they arent fancy but theyll get you there. theyve gotten me to my destination early a handful of times. theyre all over the us. and their flight attendants give the right amount of attention to you, which is none unless they absolutely have to. i like it.
1
ive heard a lot of people talk shit about southwest. i flew on an airplane for the first time last month and it was with southwest and i really thought the customer service was great as well as the staff on the plane and the cleanliness of the aircraft was good as well.
1
lets be honest, southwest is the best airline.great service, free luggage, a fine selection of soft drinks, gourmet peanuts and pretzels. these guys also had wifi on their planes before everybody else.

at least taking a flight on southwest doesnt come with a risk of being beaten up and being dragged off the plane from feet
-1
i love southwest! ive never had a problem with them. im a list and its always the best flights. plus i can change flights if needed for free. it is great for the traveling worker who actually cares about their companies money. ive only walked off of one of their planes and it was because there was severe weather and we were stuck at the gate waiting while boarded, i texted my manager about it and he looked at the radar and saw how bad it was and told me to get off the plane and to not worry about it.

i flew for the first time to go to a robotics competition in iowa. my team flew delta, and each of our 4 flights were delayed at least 3 hours. im thankful that we will be flying southwest to the next event, delta was a nightmare.

southwest knows exactly what they are doing. edit: i am in no way saying southwest is the best airline nor do i think this was staged. i just think southwest knows this is a good time to stir up some good pr videos.

southwest is now reddits favorite airline.
72
i think its funny how southwest is coming out of this trend of shitty airline behavior. ive been flying them for around 17 years and theyre fantastic. ive flown from san diego to sacramento more than 50 times with them over the years; its a rickety ride, the snacks suck, and the sodas are *always* flat and luke warm. but the crew is always solid, ive never had any problem with my luggage and i dont think twice about flying with them if i can.

1. get southwest credit card2. fly southwest.3. done.

this is like, ops *fourth* post praising southwest. just putting that out there

southwest killing the pr game right now
9
i actually sort of expected that she would have been given more ... like a lifetime pass for free airline travel with southwest airlines.  but at the same time, at least she wasnt beaten up and threatened to have her kids taken away and put into foster care ... so theres that ...
3
no shit though, i fucking love southwest airlines. it was my go-to ride back to so cal when i was stationed in the air force.  it was always the cheapest flight, they never charged for luggage, theyre flexible as shit if you need to change your flight, you can sit wherever you want...  i must have flown with them 30 times or more over the years without a hiccup. we still do the vegas flights out of la every now and then when theyre cheap enough and we dont feel like driving. they even had a goofy little tv show on hulu or crackle or something, and i watched all of them. label this post r/hailcorporate if you want, but ill shill for them all day. southwest is the shit.
15
southwest is my favorite :)
25
thought he was going to break the bottle and stab her with it, then realized this was southwest airlines and not united.

was this southwest, or the actions of a kind-hearted, passionate pilot? i see a lot of posts in this thread praising the former, when i have a feeling its the latter. seems like a pleasant guy.
8
at southwest, we pay for your seat not drag you from it.
11
i moved last year from city with a southwest hub to one with a huge delta hub. my plan was to switch my points credit card to delta once i paid off my moving expenses. i havent flown delta since i was a kid but i ended up booking a weekend trip two months after i moved. it was such a terrible experience start to finish i decided to keep my southwest card and never ever book delta again. there arent nearly as many flight options a day and sometimes its more expensive, but ill be damned if i give delta another dime. the cattle call of boarding and the inevitable confusion (im looking at you c boarding passes trying to sneak in during pre board) is annoying as all shit but otherwise i enjoy southwest.
3
when my husband and i were getting married out of state we flew with my wedding dress as a carry on. when we stopped for a layover in chicago the gate agent asked to see our boarding passes and took our tickets to "check on something." and as a bride on the way to her wedding i was terrified that there was something wrong. she gave us back our tickets with a smile.about 5 minutes later she made an announcement and asked that my future husband and i identify ourselves to the terminal gate, we obliged and raised our hand. then she announced that we were on our way to our wedding and that southwest would like to help us celebrate with a bottle of champagne. to which of course came with a round of applause from the gate. i will always choose southwest over another airline to fly.tldr: flying to my wedding with my wedding dress, southwest gave me champagne.
3
i guess southwest pr team is getting ahead of the trend on hating airlines.
5
i fly a lot internationally and on a lot of different airlines. im also platinum status on multiple ff programs. i have to say that initially i hated flying sw for us domestic travel because their frequent flyer program has no partners, they dont have a lounge and boarding is annoying. however, their service has always been great and i always found to staff to be kind and funny. i think that goes a long way to making the trip enjoyable overall. ill now sacrifice potential points and status with delta to fly southwest wherever possible, regardless of cost difference.fun side fact - worst cabin experience in the us was aa. worst cabin experience ever was air asia into dhaka.
2
https://airwaysmag.com/business-finance/southwest-pilots-highest-paid-asm/pay employees well, get nice employees. cant explain that.
2
southwest pr is on point. bringing up this vid with all the negative news about other airlines is a smart move.
2
not to mention, but it sounds like he has a few flights under his belt.[boeing 737](https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/southwest_airlines/southwest_airlines_boeing_737-700_new.php)at an avrage fill of 119 (83%full) passengers per flight, thats 8403 flights.good job.

anyone else thinking the recent spate of good guy southwest posts are probably being planted by their social media team?
2
man southwests pr team is quick
2
cant be southwest. i dont see any dogs or chickens.and howd he smuggle that much liquid on a plane?
2
southwest is just acting like that younger sibling who is acting amazing out of spite of the ass hole older sister. kudos to southwest stepping the bar up though.
2
this is great and heartwarming and all, *but...*[in 2016, southwest bumped more passengers than united, delta, or american.](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/resources/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/278481/2017-april-atcr.pdf)  they came in 11th place, #1 being hawaiian airlines with the fewest number of bumped passengers per 10,000.southwest did just recently promise to stop overbooking its flights, so well see how that goes.
2
>22 years ago retired from the us air force flying f-16s.>the past 22 years pilot of jumbo jets for southwest. i just turned 40 and i have not worked outside the home for going on 12 years. i have been a sahd that whole time. whilst that hasbeen/is rewarding in its own right, i cant help but to think i am missing out on life.   i have no career. i have no retirement savings. i have no house. no car. i get that those are material things, but again. i cant help but think i am missing something. this guy is living my dreams. to say i am envious would be a complete and utter understatement. that said, good on this guy. he seems like a really nice guy. at least he is humble and generous enough to recognize those who helped get him to where he is.
2
hell yes! i always fly southwest and honestly cant say ive had a bad experience... both, delta and frontier bent me over a raped my ass dry in front of my girlfriend while live streaming it on facebook and the only doctor that could have administer care was knocked out and dragged off for further processing (the beatings continued).... but southwest has always been consistent on pricing, no surprise baggage fees, they never minded me drinking an ass-load of airplane bottles on board (probably didnt see me pouring them into my coke) and their alcoholic drinks are only 5;  but, best of all, no rape! none of my southwest flights have included any sort of involuntary sodomy to this day and i really hope they continue this practice. "southwest: your asshole is safe with us"
2
dae like southwest airlines? dae think they are better than united and delta combined?dae think they are good for not throwing people off their planes?dae book their next trip through southwest airlines^tm?make sure to share and like and comment about how much you love southwest airlines <3
2
im flying with southwest today and have been for the past 2-3 years (since ive been flying basically).  i have never once had a bad experience and im never even hesitant to give them my business.
2
i really love southwest.  i dont fly with any other airline if i dont have to.  theyre always so nice.  like the chick-fil-a of the skies.
2
most airlines are breaking faces, southwest airlines is breaking hearts!
2
southwest is just destroying pr lately- well always i suppose but man does united blow.
2
how convinetent southwest has something wonderful and good to share among united and deltas failings. good show! /r/hailcorprate
2
great idea by the marketing team at southwest.  that might be cheap, and less glamorous, but they dont beat the living shit out of you and kick you off their planes.
2
do they do this every flight? i swear i was the millionth passenger they crammed onto the plane last time i flew southwest
2
why does it have to be southwest pilot. why cant it just be pilot? why do we have to advertise for major corporations?
6
southwest is the only airline that i have never had a problem with.
2
southwest tryna look like a hero while delta and united fall flat.
5
southwest pr guys barely have a job at this point.
2
southwest doubling down on great pr at a time when other airlines could use just slightly disappointing pr.
2
this is some hardcore southwest shilling. dont fall for it

compared to literally everyone else, southwest is having a pretty great year.
1
kinda related to this, my friend was recently a southwest flight and they sung happy birthday to one of the passengers
1
united hate delta hate southwest awhh <3
1
well that was nice but its proof that southwest is a retirement home.
1
this was good publicity. i watched this at work and couldnt stop thinking about taking a vacation the entire day. ive used southwest in the past so i went onto their site to see if there were any cheap flights and booked a roundtrip flight from ny to fl for 143 (including tax/fees) in june. good job, southwest.
1
lol southwest is just slightly better than the rest but reddit will see this and meme them to victory. they are a smart company. use reddit a hive mind to boost their sales!!! whooooo
1
another airline video? the champagne must be laced with poison! the money trafficked from babies mining blood diamonds! southwest must burn!
1
fly southwest! the heart on their logo is not for show.
1
ill have to tip my dad off to this. hes been flying for southwest for 20 years, honestly i did a double take because this looked a lot like him.
1
looks like southwest is turning into the antithesis of deltas treatment of its passenger. unfortunately i still remember when sw wouldnt let me on the plane unless i handed in my backpack as checked-in luggage before entering the plane. then presenting it in wet pieces once i landed, one by one... camera, hard drive, lenses, laptop, torn up bag. piece by piece, sliding down then banging against the side of the baggage carousel. they offered me a 75 dollar travelers check for my troubles. this was 4 years ago while i was a mfa student. i still dont even know how that happened. i guess the bag strap got stuck somewhere? the bag was a reasonable size and weight for check in but they told me they needed the space, and there was some sort limit they reached for checked in luggage. i dont get it.
1
spoiler alert not a beating, damn you southwest raising peoples expectations.
1
southwest has always been a stand up airline
1
i freakin love southwest
1
til united and delta have very different methods of surprising people than southwest.
1
hey look, another southwest ad.
1
saw another southwest story on fb today celebrating their amazing customer service. call me cynical, but this looks like the work of shills.
1
southwest has always been the best to me even before all this ridiculous shit has been happening between airlines. first of all, free bags? hell yes, that 25-50 kick in the dick for each bag before you even start your vacation is very un fun. and their wanna get away prices are typically the absolute lowest when im looking to go visit my family.

seriously need a "good guy southwest airlines" meme these days... its the only airline ive flown in the past 20 years that doesnt make me feel like a sub human just for having the audacity to travel via airplane
1
this is like the biggest fuck you to united and delta airlines. southwest is having fun.
1
i flew southwest to orlando a few years ago on a family vacation. the pilot came out before the flight and saw all the kids on the plane. on final approach, he altered the announcement slightly. "were now making our final approach to disneyworld - please fasten your seatbelts".

a bottle of korbel?  well.... it _is_ southwest.... (sigh)

southwest fucking cleaning up after the delta massacre lmao

reasons why southwest is the best. seems like the company encourages their employees to put in a personal touch. almost always best prices and their flight attendants are pretty funny. <3
1
this is good publicity for southwest amidst the united thing still going down
1
southwest is the one airline that does it right.
1
i normally flip out a little over /r/hailcorporate candidates, but im not even mad.  the whole thing looks unstaged and genuine.  southwests always been a good airline, they just dont fly how i need to fly that often (overseas) but kudos to them, they have been treating their people right forever.
1
southwest making all the right moves
1
southwest has always had the best and friendliest service of all the airlines ive travelled
1
ive always flown on southwest.  never had any problems.  fuck me right?
1
see, united, this is how you treat customers. not by punching them in the face, not by having police forcefully remove you from the seat you paid for, and not telling your customer that what they paid for isnt actually theirs because an employee needs the seat. this is why i always have and always will fly southwest.
1
ive only flown southwest over the last 8 years or so and jut assumed thats how all airlines operated. always very nice, never trying to nickel and dime you, and usually having a sense of humor. then i flew united last week. dear god. everywhere you turned they were trying to get more money out of you. even their pre and post-flight overheads had plugs to get you to spend more money. honestly, im surprised they didnt charge for the in flight snack and beverage!
1
southwest is on cloud 9 these days... and they deserve to be. theyre freaking awesome
1
its almost like some kind of conspiracy, where southwest is paying people to fly other airlines and film themselves being abused, then come in riding on a white horse doing the most awesome shit. its amazing.
1
solid move for southwest at this time.
1
southwest with all the positive pr these days
1
i fucking love southwest. none of the stupid pretense of the other airlines. local airports and crews have insane control over their operations and the focus is to get people home...case in point yesterday in pdx, plane arrived at c15 after being hit by lightening and aircraft had to be taken out of service. moved outbound passengers at c15 to another plane and gate and did the same for a bunch of flights. minor delays for everyone but common equipment and ability to swap in and out aircraft like legos means that no matter what, they are going to get you home.   weird to say, but i care about them because they have done so much for me for 20 years now.
1
this reflects alot of my experience with flying southwest. i am generally very happy with me southwest flights and use them domestically whenever i can. also take advantage of their rapid rewards program.
1
southwest is unmatched.  you can tell a good company when the majority of its employees you meet (i fly southwest monthly at the least) are kind, friendly, and sometimes straight up hilarious.
1
southwest owns.
1
southwest gave me and my 2 seatmates free beer on last nights flight and didnt even threaten bodily harm on us, it was cool.love my southwest.
1
here comes the: "this is why i love southwest" when in reality, its just a good person that really has only his own motivation to do this.
1
southwest has been my carrier of choice for many years. their staff and crew are always pleasant and their prices are great.

southwest must be pretty decent. astronaut hoot gibson flew for them for 10 years *after* flying the space shuttle five times. he wouldnt put up with a crap job after that, right? he only stopped flying southwest because of a faa mandatory retirement age of age 60 which is too young.

in college i had to write a thesis paper on a large business of my choice. i decided to write on southwest. i wrote a letter to the president, colleen barrett, asking if i could interview her. at worst expected no response. at best i expected to interview a representative of some sort. i got a letter back stating a date and time that they had me booked for a phone interview with colleen barrett herself. it was supposed to be 30 minutes, and she talked to me for well over an hour. she told me many stories from her experience with southwest in the early days as well as from her personal life. the things i learned from her about the values that southwest holds and from the way they do business, along with my own personal experience with southwest made me a customer for life. i know theyre not perfect. theyre a big business like any other. but theyll always hold a higher place in my book.

ive never have had a bad experience with southwest, most of the employees seem to really care.

out of all the airlines ive flown, southwest wins hands down. except one flight, not bad out of 100 + flights. ive flown aa (worst imo) & united as well (second worse). out of the 100 with sw, ive only had one bad incident. we were coming back from cali, with my husbands sisters cat. (she had passed away unexpectedly at the age of 25). the cat was perfect (never meowed once, but he was really scared). i asked before boarding, if it would be ok to hold him on the flight. at the ticket counter, they said it would be fine, just make sure i asked the crew. once on the flight, i explained the situation, and i was met with the coldest bitch ive ever met. she said, it was against regulations to have any animal outside of its carrier and that if i didnt put him under the seat immediately, she would put him with cargo. wtf? i stared at her for a second, trying to comprehend what she just said to me, before complying and putting his carrier under the seat. apparently i wasnt moving fast enough for her, so she put her hands on it and said "do i need to do this for you?" again, total bitch move. i said, please, no, im doing it now. (it was taking a couple of extra seconds because the lady next to me had to move her bag). once he was under, we did the flight. upon leaving, she was standing at the door, i looked at her and simply said. "god bless you". and walked away. my husbands face said it all, but it was pretty funny. (im not a religious person, but im from tx, and thats a polite way of saying "fuck you"). her eyes and face said it all, along with the captains reaction, he laughed. to that bitch, i still say "bless your heart", to the rest of sw, keep doing what youre doing, you guys rock!.

wow, cool ad! we should all watch more ads from southwest: the airline that really does care.

well played southwest,  well played... last time i flew tsa took 2 bottles of champagne from a woman and claimed that the cabin pressure changes could cause the bottles to "pop".  so is this a blatent disregard for that by a captain, or a very well placed publicity stunt?

ive flown them since before i was born. i love southwest!

ive flown probably 8 flights (4 rts) on southwest total.1 of those 8 legs, we had an insane landing. people were screaming. the lady next to me thought she was going to die.did the captain say anything after taxiing? no. not a peep. fuck you very much. weather was perfectly fine, too.united customer service might be crap, but southwests pilots are ill-trained on how to land a goddamned plane. at least, 1 out of 8 appear to be. no thanks.

i was on a southwest 737 flight back in 2012 that had an engine catch fire, leaving a trail of flames that flew past the tail. i was sleeping at a window seat right over the wing when the bright light woke me. there was surprisingly little panic, and the captain did not say anything to calm us for what seemed like 5 minutes after the event. we ended up continuing to our location (that was only 15 minutes away at this point) and landed. it was a very hard landing with only 1 active engine, and we stopped in the middle of the runway, where what looked like 40+ emergency vehicles raced towards us. they cleared us like 10 mins later and we proceeded to the terminal to depart.southwest gave me the price of my ticket refunded as credit. 8/10 would do again.

i tell you its a good thing that southwest has moved its major airline maintenance to el salvador to avoid faa inspections.swa hit with a 325k faa fine over aircraft repair august 17,2015. http://aviationblog.dallasnews.com/2015/08/southwest-airlines-hit-with-325000-faa-fine-over-aircraft-repair.html/and of course there is the 12m pocket change fine that swa airlines is fighting the faa over improper repairs.  https://consumerist.com/2014/07/28/southwest-airlines-could-face-12m-faa-fine-over-improper-repairs/none of the maintenance problems for swa let alone the rest of the us airline companies is unexpected.  back in 2009, npr put out a story about how us based airlines are using foreign maintenance sites to avoid having to actually do proper repairs and save millions.http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=113877784if a plane goes down due to bad maintenance that airline companies board should face manslaughter if they authorized bad repairs to save money overseas.

who pays if that debris hits a house or car? southwest? the manufacturer? homeowners/auto insurance?

haha, cool, i fly southwest is less than two weeks.

these airlines do the bare minimum to maintain their planes, most of them get big maintenance done in mexico with unlicensed and uneducated people. southwest is notorious for this. they obviously let this engine fester until it fucking fell apart. this is exactly like when southwest waited until the roof of their fucking jet tore open midflight in front of terrified passengers before they decided to check the integrity of their planes. they found that a large portion of their fleet was tearing apart in fundemental ways. fucking dumbshits.

welp. i got to fly friday. good thing its not with southwest.

is it me or do all southwest jets look like theyre about to fall apart?

> a southwest airlines flight just landed safely after his "major engine malfunction"oh great, so now were assigning genders to flights. why cant we just let them identify as whatever they want?
-1
southwest sucks. horrible service, bad time management. all around bad airlines. had a 2 bad experiences, never will fly with them again
-1
i will never fly southwest again because they put ads on the fucking tray tables, hope delta doesnt start.flying in two weeks but this doesnt bug me.

could there be something about the design of the device the punctures the battery under the right circumstances? maybe its not actually the batteries?side note: southwest still makes you power down devices before taking off?

i just flew southwest twice last weekend. they even tell passengers that if they have a note 7 it should be turned off for the entirety of the flight.

lol, samsungs denial game is strong:["there is no evidence that this incident is related to the new note 7."](http://bgr.com/2016/10/05/galaxy-note-7-recall-samsung-fire-southwest/)
