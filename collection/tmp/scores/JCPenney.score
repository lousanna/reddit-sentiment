http://thekrazycouponlady.com/2015/09/30/10-off-10-purchase-at-jcpenney/if youre referring to 10 off 10 coupon by using an app, it is also the cost of acquiring a new customer. the expense may be something the advertising or marketing department pays off. if jc penney marks up items on average 30% above their price, then 10 off 10 is really costing them 7 in inventory. they hope you continue to shop with jcp even after the first purchase using your coupon.
