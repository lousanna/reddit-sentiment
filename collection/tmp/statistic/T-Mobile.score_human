you know whats sad?  i live in korea and i have unlimited 3g cellular data.  this is fast enough to stream hd videos to my phone as well as computer with free hotspotting.  i have no need for internet service at home because of this.  i typically use over 100 gb a month of data.i went to thailand this year and purchased unlimited roaming from my cellular provider in korea, which partners with the providers in thailand on their infrastructure.  so i was in pretty remote areas in thailand and the service was quite good, still able to stream videos pretty much anywhere except one really off the grid remote village.then i went back to america for winter vacation.  i purchased the same deal with my korean provider and used the att and t-mobile infrastructure in the midwest.  the service was ok until i hit 1 gb and it seemed to be so obviously throttled that i could no longer even load a simple webpage on my phone.  my data was virtually useless most of the time in america.  the same thing happened to my korean fiance who was visiting the us for the first time in her life.so i felt the need to apologize for the technological inadequacy of my country.  i had to apologize for the fact the greyhound driver was an hour late to work, then the bus broke down.  i had to apologize for the fact there was a homeless person on every street block.  small, exploitative corporate practices like throttling cellular and are making a few people a lot of money, but america is slowly falling behind other countries in many ways because of it. the sad part is most americans will never know how much they are being exploited and sold out.

maybe i just do more reading than the average t-mobile customer, but i knew this was the bingeon trade off from day 1. you can use bingeon, but know the quality isnt going to be as good, or just go back to the way things were before.and it doesnt require "calling customer service" (which i hate) - its as simple as clicking a button in your dashboard on the website.

you know, if t-mobile offered the users a app on their phone that wold throttle the data incoming to 1.5meg, then when active report back to t-mobile that data is throttled so it would be unlimited, then i do not think this would be an issue. the device itself doing the throttling, that would not be against net neutrality or unfair, no opt ins or any bs like that, just an app the user can turn on whenever they want to throttle eveything for unlimited usage.

i really expected more from t-mobile then these bs terminology games in an attempt to deceive customers. yes technically and legally they are not throttling.  they slow down data rates for sites that dont pay them money.  yes they are the same thing in the eyes of customers, but legally they are not.  the ceo knows this and knows what people were really asking but instead of being open about it he hid behind terminology.  customer: are you throttling video? t-mobile: no! we would never do that.customer: are you throttling some video?t-mobile: of course not!customer: are you intentionally slowing down transfer rates for some sites that do not pay you for expected transfer rates? t-mobile: oh yeah, we do that, but that is not throttling.

i know this isnt the popular opinion on reddit, but lets be real here.t-mobile has been pro net-neutrality from the beginning. without t-mobile, the cell phone industry would still be the same stagnant industry it was several years ago. while you may not like this so called "throttling" the fact of the matter is that it can be turned off very easily.

this whole "issue" would all go away if t-mobile were just open about what binge on does.  is it really that terrible that they offer customers free data, which is throttled in speed?  if you want to actually binge on with your phone, you can turn it on.  otherwise, just leave it off and have normal speeds.  why is this such a big deal?
-0.3
i just want to point this out. i have t-mobile with the free 1gb plan.... so i dont actually pay for data. for the longest time, after i hit the 1gb mark, my data slows to a crawl. i cant watch videos or anything that requires that kind of speed. now... for some reason, since like, 3 months ago, i dont get throttled at all. my bill cycle ends tomorrow and ive used 7gb without noticing any loss in speed. it could just be that they have increased the throttle speed slightly. i dont do anything crazy on my phone to notice a slight change like that, but ive had zero issue playing youtube videos.i would question it, but why would i? as of right now, im essentially getting free unlimited data.

i used to work for one of the other big 2 cellular companies, what t-mobile is doing which many may disagree with is attempting to optimize the network.  they are wholly much better ethically then verizon and at&t, for that reason i try to see their good in the marketplace instead of their flaws.  i have unlimited with them, i turned binge on to "off" and everythings the same as it was before.  i think this is a small issue being blown out of proportion.

ive been on t-mobile for 4 years now. and their voice and data coverage are generally good in the big cities. once you are out of the big cities, your mileage will vary. so if you are on the road a lot and driving in the middle of nowhere, then t-mobile is not for you. im pretty happy with them as im saving probably 150/month on my family plan compare to at&t or verizon. i dont have a problem with this binge thing since it seems to benefit the lower data plan people. but im glad people made a big deal about it so that i know whats going on and found out about the option to disable it.

im a t-mobile employee. binge on is an awesome service. hes it does make quality less but honestly most people cant even tell the diffrence. i have so many customers everyday talk about how much they love it. people are just so sick of running out of data and being charged out the wahzoo by the other carriers. first i always tell people it does make the quality less and i also always tell them how to turn it off. its just a option people have that they can utilize if they want to. the reason its opt out only is because if it wasnt people would be watching netflix, hulu, espn, or whatever and watching their data go down and be pissed because they thought it wouldnt use their data. so its kinda of a win lose situation. i think less people will be upset if its opt out. also, i dont understand why people are so upset about john he says it like it is and is transparent with people, unlike all the other carriers ceos . he is breaking the rules and disrupting the status quo. he is setting new expectations and fighting for the consumer. he is the kind of person you want as a ceo. stop complaining about throttling you self entitled hipsters. jesus.

t-mobile is maybe my least favorite company. as a customer, i moved to a place without coverage, which according to the t&c of the contract, was my fault. i had two months left on a contract, and id been a customer for 5 years. anyhow, i called and asked them to waive the cancellation fee. they helpfully explained to me that i could still use my phone at home (since my home had the internet) thus, their product still worked  and they couldnt waive the cancellation fee. in other words, since i paid someone else for internet, my "phone" worked on wifi, and thus still "worked." i paid the fee and decided to hate them forever.

i switched to t-mobile about 6 months ago, because i want to actively reward companies who actually make an effort to compete. its been ok, but ill have to reluctantly go back to verizon once ive paid off the phones. verizon is more expensive, but where i live (suburb outside seattle), the t-mobile signal is unreliable at the best of times, non-existent at the worst. they sent me an in home signal booster which works about 50% of the time, as long as youre standing within 10 feet of it. even while out and about, ive found the signal to be unreliable much of the time. its especially annoying considering the fact that the coverage map suggests excellent coverage more or less everywhere i spend any significant amount of time, but this doesnt seem to jive with reality.its all well and good having better pricing, but the network is ultimately what really matters.
52.5
t-mobile is great. their coverage is questionable.i live in canada 6 months of the year and the usa for 6 months. **t-mobile does not charge roaming on texts, data, or calls while im in canada.** the data speed is said to be slowed to 3g or 2g although i often get 4g (if not 4g lte). the only catch here is that they charge you long distance on calls, which makes sense. they were also open about this, which is all i ask most of the time.at least theres finally a company whos calling everyone out about roaming charges. its all bullshit. it doesnt cost the company anything extra.if you dont travel a whole lot (especially out west) it should be fine. if you live in a medium-large city surrounded by other similar cities you should be fine.its the little towns and places in the north west that you start losing service.i support them fully, regardless of their coverages because theyre the only company i know making an effort to compete with larger companies - the proper way.

i live in northern colorado along the front range (basically the line that runs straight south where all the cities are, and thus towers). i switched from att to t-mobile this summer and its been great.  i went in the monday after i heard about the ceos epic rant about how verizon and att are raping their customers.  i can support that kind of crazy/blunt ceo.  and hes right when you consider how t-mobile plans work.  go over your data limit?  they dont give a fuck.  they wont charge you more, you just get bumped down from the lte until next bill cycle.  also spotify and whatnot dont even count against your data, which was the bulk of my data usage at att.  and no contract.  so long as you dont owe on your phone you can totally just shut off your phone for a couple of months if you know you wont be needing it or if money is tight.  and their upgrade plan is pretty legit/uncomplicated.  pay off half your phone and you can trade it in regardless of how long youve had it.9/10 would recommend to fellow fort collins/boulder/denver residents.

im always surprised at the people that complain about t-mobiles coverage.  ive never had a problem with it.  its great in metro atlanta and metro denver, and i had no problems with it driving between the two.  im sure there were spots of no service, but i didnt notice.  i certainly had a serviceable signal any time i needed it.  the lte was missing between cities, but thats a sacrifice im willing to make for the cost/customer service/corporate attitude.

they gained me and lost me in the same quarter.  i love their model, but they have a fraud problem. i purchased a used tmobile gs5 for 500.  i took it to the store, did the online imei checkers and everything came back clean and not financed.  now, its still coming back as clean (aka, not stolen), but its "financed not paid" now.  whats interesting is that i specifically inquired as to whether the phone was "financed".in any case, i, the paying customer, was forced to ditch t-mobile and go to cricket because i cant have a 500 paperweight.  they could have written it off and continued to pull in 128/mo on my family plan, but instead they chose to give me the opportunity to pay off someone elses phone.someone defrauded t-mobile, but it wasnt me.  someone else effectively borrowed money to get a new gs5.  that contract was between t-mobile and them.  i fully support t-mobile taking them to court/collections/etc to get their money back.  if (and only if) t-mobile had marked the phone as "financed", id even support them turning off the phone; however, they did not.  t-mobile has a fraud problem.  either they need to fix the problem for their legit paying customers (like i was), or they need to stop giving 600 loans to assholes off the street who will pawn the phone a month later with no collateral.

/r/hailcorporateno but seriously, the american market for internet access is really fucked up. both the wireless(cellular) and physical markets are controlled by companies unwilling to deliver internet access and there is no real competition to replace them. at&t, verizon etc are screwing the customers. i hope t-mobile is sucessful at creating some needed competition in the market.

good, id been with at&t since the first iphone. moved to a new city this month and turns out i was using too much data (no internet in new place) so at&t decided to throttle my unlimited data plan that ive had for seven years from 35mbps to 0.5mbps. told em "see ya" and walked right over to t-mobile since my contract was up. i get unlimited everything and a 5gb a month hotspot. the building penetration needs works but overall im happy with the move.

i really appreciate how t-mobile is shaking up the cellular business model, but honestly my year with them has been mediocre to downright shitty.  their customer support is off shored and terrible on the phone, and even the in-store people cant get things right in my experience.i sent a phone in for a warranty repair and it took a month to get the replacement sent back to me...*without a battery cover*.  the store had no replacement covers, and both phone and store support acted like it was my fault for sending in the phone with accessories (like i should know that a battery cover is considered an accessory!).  after a whole lot of back and forth for a couple weeks one store manager finally just gave me a new in box phone, which is what they should have done from day one instead of making it a six week ordeal to replace my phone that bricked after a month and a half.  apparently my complaint tickets opened eventually got resolved, because six months later (no joke) i finally received the battery cover i no longer needed in the mail.oh and if you want a loaner phone while you wait for the warranty repair it takes a 50 deposit and its not even a smart phone.

frankly, i couldnt stand t-mobile. very spotty connections and flat out poor service overall. pretty much had to buy a sd card for my phone so that i could actually use spotify by downloading the playlists at home via wifi so i could play the file locally instead of streaming it.i am dreadfully sorry, but i should not completely lose all connectivity 5 times on a 20 minute trip down a freeway or in the middle of a major city.not to mention the time i went into a branch to inquire about some of the charges on my account and why my bill wasnt the same every month, even though my usage was the same... found long distance/additional packages i never asked for! shit like an additional sim card for the account for "if like, you ever wanted another phone on the same line". the best part about it was, they never even gave me the sim card, i just assumed it was some in-app shit goin on and didnt think of it. but then i switched banks and the card that was registered to my googleplay account was closed and my bill was still goin naners. to cap all of that off, when i went to the branch to ask about these things, it was about a week after my cable was out for a few days.i had mobile fucking hotspot. never asked for it. never was even asked if i did or did not want it. just fucking had it. wish ida known about it.scrapped them and got cricket instead, now at least im getting charged much less for my shitty service.

ive worked for t-mobile on and off for years, dating back to their rogers years. i can assure you that they do provide information upon government request and some of those requests are in fact in the realm of what this statement is claiming they dont do.fact, all carriers have a relationship, some more cozy than others with various factions of law enforcement.additional fact, t-mobile runs an amdocs billing system. amdocs, an israeli company which has more or less been subsidized by their government to the point of snatching up almost all large and certainly all relevant billing system operations for the telco industry is sitting on one fuck load of interesting data. *edit, i should add that back in the days before t-mobile when the company was voicestream wireless lers were in fact not always handled in a timely manner. this had everything to do with the fact that the company was growing quickly through acquisitions of other companies and busy integrating their billing systems while also rolling out a new billing system themselves. it was not that they were somehow less shitty than other companies or "there for the customers" it was simply that they did not have the capacity to answer requests in a timely manner. moreover the prepay world has and will always be the realm of pimps and dealers, this is not unique to any carrier in particular. in fact prepay was at first the redheaded step-child of the organization -- they gave a tenacious bitch some money and told her to go off and build it out but keep it separate, keep it quiet and basically fuck off because it will never be worth anything. tracking down "burners" is a fucking pita in most ways, but pro-tip for you all out there, swapping sim cards is only half the battle. keeping the same phone opens your imei up for tracking -- although there are ways around that. i recall fun stories after an acquisition of a carrier with a large florida presence wherein there seemed to be an inordinate number of "engineer" phones, all virtually untraceable and open for business in every way possible.the fact that the company runs at all is in large part because of a very dedicated and small cadre of folks on the network/engineering/database realms often running things in the background and directly against mandates from an increasingly top loaded management structure - the worst of which who came in a bit of irony from an acquisition of powertel some time ago. put simply those nitwit good ol boys from atlanta very nearly caved the entire organization. alas, that is a story for another time. sadly, most of the original members who made the company what it is have left, this will serve as the final nail in the coffin of what was a great small company that grew into a unique somewhat large company.
