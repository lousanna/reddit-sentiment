**there is!!!! its called switch**problem is, not a lot of companies actually use the app. so, the app gathers data from job sites and turns it into "matches". of the 30 jobs ive swiped right, none have matched.... wow, this is a lot like tinder actually... **edit:** /u/hari_ananth mentioned **jobr**, which i just tried out - its quite good!

the employers can hire someone for a day and then fire them as soon as their done with the job! it will be just like tinder.

this already happens. ive been in meetings where a dozen resumes are on a powerpoint presentation and its literally ctrl-x for to "left swipe" the ones that dont seem to work out.that said (honestly not trying to gain any karma here), while its an arduous task, unlike tinder where decisions are made in a second, our team really did go through each resume.

this actually sounds like a great idea, except the fact that even on tinder, they dont tell you who swipes left on you (correct me if im wrong), which would practically be like it is now where jobs wont tell you if you didnt get the job.maybe this should be a real app. im sure this would literally be a game-changer in the job application digital world, competing with sites like linkedin, and even job boards like snagajob.

heres some other interesting facts:match group created both match.com and tinder.  [they bought okcupid for 50 million in 2011](http://mashable.com/2011/02/02/match-okcupid/#fvghokyadqq1) and [bought pof for 575 million last year](https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/14/match-group-buys-plentyoffish-for-575m-to-bag-more-singles/).  match group is owned by iac, who also owns companies like [collegehumor, vimeo, and the daily beast](http://iac.com/brands).

goddamnit, pub trivia owes me two points!they asked what popular dating site spawned tinder and my husband (who weirdly, i met on okcupid) said okcupid.  the trivia dj said match.com was the correct answer.  theyre both correct, harts turkey farm pub and family restaurant, theyre both correct!
19.8832
anyone else notice a huge difference in the clientele? i notice the most attractive and well-off girls seem to be on tinder only with a huge standard population. plenty of fish seems to be much more low-income and a lot more minorities than tinder. okcupid seems to have more of the standard attractiveness to low because okcupid hopes to help you find a connection based on questions and drawn out profiles.

in my experience, okc is the only one that actually led to results. ive been seeing one particular girl for about 1.5 years or more. and we actually get along better than anyone ive ever met, be it irl or through the internet. tinder is garbage. pof was garbage. all spam. nobody ever responds to messages. only bots. also, fetlife is garbage for meeting people. its not quite a dating site, but still dont expect anything to come out of being on fetlife, unless you got tits.

-tinder is for banging college aged chicks in cities-pof is for banging townies, pregnant chicks, trashy single moms-match.com is for meeting women in their late 20s/early 30s. actually pretty legit-okcupid is for banging liberal feminist chicksthey just diversified their revenue streams

doesnt matter, these are just message services. the people are what make the sites unique. tinder being mostly young hip people, pof mostly sleazy desperates and okcupid being more sincere desperates

so is that why ive never been messaged first on okc or tinder and ive only had 5 girls total actually talk to me in the year ive been using them?but i try grindr for literally one day and i have 15-20 guys (and 3 trans women) message me and honestly seem interested in meeting/dating or hooking up?
0.7236
it makes sense to me. theyre kind of different levels of dating interests. tinder = normal hookups. pof = trashy hookups. okc = hookups but if we stay friends thats cool too. match = i want to get married and have babies asap, but in that order.

iac and ceo barry diller have been riding the "lets buy lots of websites!!" business model since the late 90s. most of them fail, some of them get huge. rinse and repeat. been there, done that, have a stupid iac coffee mug at home in my pantry as proof (obviously i wasnt in on tinder, just one of the other 200 bombs). iac blows.

i refuse to use tinder, and have had plenty of luck with pof. be attractive, have a beard, no more than 3pics, no dick pics and dont write a book. if you can get her to message you every day for 2 weeks shes yours, you can usually get a date in half that but ive found more promise taking ur time because they are strangers, and there are weirdos.

what a surprise, this entitled asshole also pleaded no contest to raping 2 minors as an 18 year old: http://nextshark.com/nick-vedovi-charged-rape-of-minors-assault-and-battery-2011/. this right here is why we as a society should have zero tolerance for men who harass women (or people who harass others in general, honestly) - calling someone a bitch on tinder might seem minor, but that sense of entitlement is a huge contributing factor to our sexual assault problem.

edit: on second thought the information in this post makes me really easy to find, as ive posted it on other forums which can be linked back to me. it was years ago and im over it. im just going to be less specific in what happened: a woman did something very inappropriate to me and tinder refused to help. i apologize for deleting the specifics but if this thread gets big i dont want someone to google details of what i posted and then cross-post it here.

> hate is not an option and we will continue to fight it wherever it rears its ugly head.yeah, theres no trace of hate in this letter or anywhere else online towards this guy. nope, none whatsoever. down with nick hate!dont get me wrong; he completely deserves getting banned from tinder, but this kind of public humiliation with the intent of barring him from getting a job is just hateful and malicious, and its certainly not going to change any sexists or racists minds about these topics. this is exactly the sort of thing that will just further the polarisation that is happening in the west.

tinder is an independent start-up based in west hollywood, ca with sean rad as founder/ceo. iac only owns 10% of tinder. its more of an investor than anything.

what is tinder?
-0.0
the biggest issue is that the app is rapidly declining in popularity. up until a few months ago, everything was free. now, you only get a certain amount of swipes, without being requested to pay and there are other features that can only be unlocked by paying. the majority of users are college students that use the app to hook up, so theres not going to be a big demand for paying customers. as theyve introduced new, costly features, other companies have been moving into the dating app realm using the same free and simple format that tinder used to use.source: may or may not use the app as described in my post

i think you guys seem to be looking at this wrong, its not just tinder as you have okcupid and plenty of fish which are widely used and reach pretty much every demographic. if you want a stock that covers the booming internet dating segment this is probably the way to go

too many competitors. if i search "tinder" on my play store a different app comes up in first place and tinder is 2nd. theres tons of competitor apps that do things that tinder used to do. it wont be a buy for me unless they go back to their original model or do some changes.
