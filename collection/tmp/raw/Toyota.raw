maybe the dealer owns a toyota dealer as well?

its possible that the kia dealership is also owned by someone who also runs a toyota dealership. perhaps even in the same building.[one local company](https://www.facebook.com/capitalautogroup/photos/a.353059378076227.72573.161995443849289/638920319490130/?type=1&theater) runs dealerships for bmw/mini, subaru, mistubishi, hyundai, and hino trucks. [another company](http://www.penneygroup.ca/automotive.php) owns the local toyota, mazda, and kia, honda, and mercedes dealershipssaid subaru, mitsubishi, and hyundai dealerships also use mercedes sprinters as their customer shuttles (mostly because neither brand makes a commercial vehicle of that size)edit: there *is* a round rock toyota down the road, but they appear to have different owners. in this case, it is rather odd.

laughing at all these people saying kias are junk. apparently they havent looked at or test drove one within the last 8 years. kia doesnt make a truck that is available in the u.s. so therefore would explain why they are using a toyota pickup. source: work in the parts department of a kia dealership, so i see what is commonly replaced on these things.

not an uncommon thing, especially if that dealer owns other dealers as well (i also see round rock honda, nissan and toyota dealerships using a quick search). i used to work for a chevrolet dealer, and our company also owned kia and mitsubishi dealers. the mitsubishi dealer had a pickup of their own but im pretty sure the kia dealer used a silverado. its especially common when the manufacturer the dealer owns doesnt make a pickup (and kia doesnt). these are usually parts trucks, picking up and delivering parts.

thats kinda deceptive, the dealership may also sell toyotas or maybe they have another store which sells em.

the toyota dealership i work for uses a ford for its complimentary shuttle. a sienna just isnt big enough.
2
dealer: oh yeah? *swiftly rips off toyota logo*
2
maybe kia and toyota are owned by the same people?
2
maybe the owner of that dealer owns a toyota dealership too. i see it all the time, multiple brands, one owner.
2
people trashing on kia because it makes them sound cool i guess.they have one of the best warranties on the market, having just done car shopping over the last month. i bought a soul, and i am over the moon happy with it. all this is, is probably the fact that someone owns both dealerships, and had a spare used toyota that they wanted to repurpose.
2
im pretty sure that its an auto group with kia and toyota. i bought a car from there. also, the manager of the kia dealership got murdered last month and his wife was arrested.
3
sometimes its the automotive group that owns the dealers and they own a chevy, honda and toyota dealer so just pick the best to use.

funny since i got my used toyota at a kia dealership.
1
this is very common. i used to work for boch honda and we used a toyota tundra as a company car. two days after they got all the nice decals on it i totaled it. now they have a honda ridgeline.

the same dealership owns a toyota dealership. whats really funny is seeing a ford f-250 as a cummins company truck.

bmw dealer in southern california uses toyota and scion for their parts delivery.  face it, its all about reliability, toyotas dont break down as much as bmws do.  kind of funny though.
1
as the owner of a toyota with over 300k miles, i dont blame them.
1
we use honda/toyota minivans and a mb sprinter van as customer & employee shuttles at our bmw dealership.

i read on imgur that toyota owns kia, true??  (i couldnt find it)

im a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/cars] [this kia dealership uses a toyota as the company car...

they are just forcing the toyota to watch as they sell kias
1
and toyotas are made by hyundai robots.
1
if that toyota would be a sentient being it would be ashamed as hell to have kia painted all over his face...
1
most for profit business are gonna use a toyota. i work for a kia/mazda dealership and we had an old camry for running errands in
1
there is also a round rock toyota and round rock honda, they used to all be right next to each other. i think the same parent company owns all three dealers.
1
doesnt toyota own kia?
-5
this is a 2001-2005 toyota tundra. one of the most reliable and durable trucks ever made. stop bashing on it. its only ugly because it has a shitty kia paint job. my 01 v8 tundra will be 200,000 miles in a few months. runs like an old dirty man with a lot of fight left in him.
-1
yeah, because kia and toyota are owned by hyundai
0
almost as un-thrilling as the hundreds of other similar examples of this over my lifetime. this is what i get for lurking sites that cater to a... younger clientele.   oh cool a toyota! with kia logos! cool! thats funny! oy...
-1
toyota and kia have the same parent company i thought
-10
if it runs like a toyota, it must be a kia.
-2
toyotas are rarely kia. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/killed_in_action

auto companies like bmw and toyota have been researching on self driving cars much much ahead of google. just because google gets publicity doesnt mean that they are the only one working on it.source: myself. worked on toyota autonomous car research while at university.

i saw (what im mostly sure was) toyotas car driving itself on i-90 outside of rockford on my way to madison last summer.  it looked pretty slick.

imagine for a moment that, instead of companies like toyota and google working independently of each other to develop the same technology in private (resulting in unnecessary duplication of effort and wasted resources), that they instead pool their resources and knowledge and work together to maximize the technology (thus reducing wasted effort and resources due to unnecessary duplication).
