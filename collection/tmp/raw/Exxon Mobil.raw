anybody that invests in exxon mobile and has no idea that global warming will have an impact on the largest oil corporation in the history is an idiot. of course the company holding your money isnt going to tell you a major threat is upcoming. hard to feel bad for oil investors who were told, by an oil company, that global warming isnt a threat.

exxon mobil is virtually its own nation state.  it has its own agenda and that agenda has zero to do with the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of americans.
