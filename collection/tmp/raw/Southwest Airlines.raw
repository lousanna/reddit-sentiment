every time ive gotten on a southwest airlines plane, its always some model from the 70s/80s that feels like its going to rattle itself apart midair. im convinced im gonna die on one of these things.i should not have clicked on this.

> a southwest airlines flight just landed safely after his "major engine malfunction"oh great, so now were assigning genders to flights. why cant we just let them identify as whatever they want?

"southwest airlines says that safety is their main priority and the delay only lasted about 10 minutes"in the name of safety, at least their humanity was only publicly  questioned for about 10 minutes.-edit: im sure their humanity was questioned for more than 10 minutes, for the sake of a short post, i simplified it.

its disgusting that the swa employee sided with the ignorant racist and tried to give the boot to these guys (who had done absolutely nothing wrong) instead of telling them to fuck right off. if you have an irrational fear of someone you certainly have the right to not get on a plane with them or as one of the victims suggested "to take the bus". you do not, however, have the right to victimize other people.if anything, assholes like that should be named and publicly shamed, not have their bigotry reinforced. oh and what a massive waste of police time, you asshole (the bigot, not the victims who were forced to call them)coming soon from southwest airlines: "solo flights" for people who dont feel comfortable flying with anyone else, such as:* arabs  ("terrorists")* blacks ("gang bangers")* latinos ("cartel members")* asians ("yakuza")* caucasians ("kkk members")* etc.

anyone notice how at the end of the video southwest airlines says "safety is our main priority."

southwest airlines employees seem to be a bit prejudicial at times. they kicked a lesbian couple off a flight for "excessive pda." their excuse was because they are a family airline. this is why i like to call them southworst. https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/leisha-hailey-l-word-actress-kicked-off-southwest-flight-for-kissing-girlfriend/2011/09/27/giqalimq1k_blog.html

isnt southwest airlines notorious for being terrible?

so the real issue here isnt that random dumbass is racist, its that southwest airlines is.

the worst of experiences. this shows how the media has focussed in making people generalise as all african americansm are criminals, all arabic speaking humans are terrorist. southwest airlines must ensure that arabic speaking people are also safe to fly by theirs and this couple is compensated for the time wasted!

>"if that person doesnt feel safe, let them take the bus," khalil said to a southwest airlines gate agent. "were american citizens just like everybody else."yes, but could he say it in english.

"if that person doesnt feel safe, let them take the bus," khalil said to a southwest airlines gate agent. "were american citizens just like everybody else."yeah, ummm, no youre not.  you just dont flop on over to the u.s. to wherever the hell you came from, do a little paperwork song and dance and now all of a sudden you are an american.  just like i cant just flop on over to germany, fill out a form, then declare "i am a german."you deserved to get kicked off the flight.  have a little common sense & courtesy you rude, people.

hi, your friendly neighborhood full-time voice actor here.  nobody asked me, but ill weigh in anyway, since i do a lot of character work.its easy to mimic characters while saying lines they normally say (like whats up, doc?) but its not easy to mimic a character doing lines they normally dont say.  and no looney tunes character has ever said a southwest airlines safety speech.  so despite some flubs i think its still a pretty decent start, given that its not easy to maintain a consistent characterization that wasnt originally yours while doing lines that werent original to that character.that being said, this started out mildly impressive and then went about three times longer than necessary.  also, once he got about 3-4 impressions deep, the integrity of his impressions really went downhill and they all mashed together in a rather unintelligible mess.  i think the cute girl next to him got him a little carried away.  i was cringing through about the last 3/4 of the video.  summary:  a hearty "meh"

i originally read this title as "southwest airlines removes woman from flight after they are notified her son was an accident." what business is it of theirs if a womans son was born from an unplanned pregnancy!
