palantir?  as in the crystal balls from lord of the rings that connected you directly to sauron and tended to drive people insane? who thought that was a good name for a product?   its like theyre advertising their evil. edit: lol.  yes, i know they werent evil originally. :-)  but theres a lot more people in the world whove seen lotr than have read the silmarillion.  and they *were* pretty thoroughly corrupted by the end of the third age.

palantir isnt fucking secretive. just go on youtube and see a million different videos they post about their products and how they can be used. they sell software that can be used to interpret data, but probably will never know what type of data you are using it for.[intro to palantir video from their own fucking youtube channel](http://youtu.be/f86vkjfsmje)
362
what is with the techmedias need to sensationalize palantir so much? all of this information was already readily available online, even in product demos the company has posted on youtube. it even has a hands-on demo available online. all palantir does is impose a graphical link analysis interface and data mining / machine learning tools over already existing databases. is it revolutionary? yes, in the sense that it simplifies the hell out of big data analysis. but secretive it is not, almost all of this information been published in news media already, often through interviews with the company.

palantir sells data analysis tools. search / replace "palantir" for "excel" and the article would be equally correct. if you were so inclined you could recreate a lot of the functionality palantir offers by gluing together some open-source etl tools, a graph database, elasticsearch for keyword identification / indexing / search, something like gefi or d3 for visualisation, revolution r for analytics, blah blah (obviously nowhere as packaged / functional; im just saying this isnt rocket science).
16
for financial firms, their biggest source of data is your own credit card.  nobody cares about *your* data, the power comes when millions of peoples data is all analyzed in aggregate.  this is what palantir does.imagine you own a chain of coffee shops, and youre looking to build a new one.  you have 3 potential locations in mind, which do you choose?  hopefully the one with the highest traffic of people who drink coffee, right?  well, since you need a construction loan to build the shop you talk to a few banks.  they all have similar interest rates, but one of them goes a step further with their presentation and includes a google map of your potential locations overlayed with your exact target demographic!  since the bank has all of your financial information already, they can isolate men and women between 25-55 (from your name and birthdate), with an income over 50k a year (from your direct deposits), that spend money at either starbucks or dunkin donuts 3 or more times a week (from your credit card), and buy lunch 3 or more times a week, and highlighting the most used commuting roads for those people so that you can visually see that these people generally drive from the suburbs on a specific road into the city (the path between those two charge locations).thats pretty powerful.  and not at all intrusive to anybody.  if you dont want that data out there, just use cash, but you might end up with a worse cup of coffee.

was that meant to be interesting, or just sound like a sales pitch? 9/10 vets prefer palantir. great, now wheres my civil liberties.
29
a palantir is a very dangerous tool, saruman. there are many that are not accounted for...

some of my friends had a kickstarter for hand-crafted marshmallows. palantir turned out to be one of their biggest customers... which really weirded us out when we discovered their true nature....
5
somewhat relevant: my cousin used to work for palantir as a paid intern. he said they treated their employees excellently and that everyone there was super smart and nerdy compared to him, and that it paid extremely well for the few months he was there.
12
this "leaked" document reads an awful lot like an advertisement for palantir. i dont know...
2
this thread reads like a fucking palantir op...so much obfuscation.i was a speaker at a conference where one of the cofounders of palantir (joe) was a speaker.  i have never seen such a douchey human being in my life.  complete tool who just wanted to be praised as opposed to say anything of substance.  he ended up basically just listing the people he new and talked about the uk governments "spy ladies".  i sort of wish i had a video of it to post and shame him but i think he would probably be proud of it.

> sergeant peter jackson of the lapd> palantirtbf how do you not buy software called palantir when your name is peter jackson.

so, yeah: i was hired to write a tool that sort of competed with palantir (but i didnt know i was competing with palantir at the time).it did evil things like integrate with sharepoint, use tree-based analysis methods to link data & concepts and allow very granular analysis of complex supply & demand networks, funding programs and other such things that you wouldnt immediately think were related to each other...but it was designed to allow you to connect those things and track what influenced what once youd drawn those connections. its not really magic, but palantir have a lot of people working out little niche adapters into just about every database you can imagine, with lots of web scraping power too. edit: so heres a comparison between theirs and mine.[theirs](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/palantir-software.png)[mine](http://www.stormwind-studios.com/ark/lsa/lsaws.png)

i have been at meetings with a representative of palantir. we exchanged business cards. the title on the card said rep handed me was, i shit you not, "civil liberties engineer".it was hard to stifle my laugh, but i managed; gotta remain professional!

what happened to all the cs students on reddit? anyone whos been to a tech career fair knows palantir is not some evil corporation
1
this company is basically a private intel company or more simple a ngo nsa. anybody suggesting there isnt anything secretive about them is either a palantir shill or totally clueless. let the downvotes begin (or will they?).

> is there still any hype for palantir from top engineering talent?palantirs image has dropped dramatically recently. a lot of it is due to its inconsistent interview process and people figuring that the work palantir does isnt as interesting as they make it sound.
466
that sucks, imo, almost no job is worth going through that. after what ive heard about palantir there is no way id apply and no reason i would want to work there. i could be wrong since i dont have much experience(im a senior with intern experience) and all ive heard is secondhand, but...but it really seems like does not live up to the hype they try to generate about themselves. ive heard about them doing shady bait switch stuff to try and get people into the forward deployed engineer role when the person didnt even apply to it and explicitly said they didnt want to go to that role. at least for hiring they seem to have some sucky practices. also ive heard about some people having some not so fun overtime, not into that at all. but im also not the super ambitious type that only wants to work at the big n so mileage may vary i guess depending on what motivates you.
109
i never really understood the hype.  when it was more of an unknown company i was contacted to interview there.  i looked up what they do and the way i read it was they basically work on some of the the big brother infrastructure used by people like the nsa.  i replied to the recruiter with a question, wondering if they realized the real palantir were corrupted by sauron and used for evil.  funny enough the recruiter came back with "we get asked that a lot" and a pitch about how it is only used for altruistic causes like "catching terrorists".  right, nice try saruman
141
fyi, if youre being considered for a forward deployed engineer role at palantir, they do not respect you. fde == consultant.

i think that this mentality comes down to that companies like palantir have these outrageous interview processes, because some people are really willing to endure them to get a job. there was a post a couple months back on this sub of someone saying the same thing about khan academy as youre saying for palantir. [the top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4xfkc7/for_the_love_of_god_please_stop_peeing_in_the/) on this sub delves into this idea a bit.
28
palantir is trash. cult-like culture, rampant egomania and over-inflated sense of their worth, not to mention that some of the work they do is shady. stay far away.

i had a similar experience. i graduated from berkeley and, honestly, at the time, palantir was one of my top choices (2012), well above microsoft/apple, but maybe not quite as high as dropbox/facebook.the process was pretty straightforward from phone call, to phone screen. i even got taken out to dinner, picked up from east bay berkeley to palo alto in a luxury black car before i even applied and that made a tremendous impression on me. this was something like a 90 minute limo drive, just to get me to consider applying formally. i was very impressed with everyone i talked to at this stage. but my onsite interview was a joke.i grew up around washington, d.c., so i was interested in going back there for my internship and one of my interviewers was a forward deployed engineer working in that area. i was asked inane trivia questions like, how to combine grep and less functionality without the use of a pipe, or how to search a directory of compressed files without typing extra parameters (zgrep, which maps to grep with a parameter). the entire interview was based on terminal commands with artificial constraints and him boasting about how he was saving the world fighting terrorists. i was honestly mildly angry the entire interview, since it felt like he was searching for questions that i couldnt possibly answer. maybe it was some weird culture interview where he wanted to see how i would react to him being difficult, but it felt like he just wanted to show me up with his superior sysops capabilities (i was interviewing as a software engineer) and how close he was to being in the military.nowadays, you are definitely dodging a bullet. palantir has almost certainly peaked and is in rapid decline. one of my roommates worked at the palo alto office and has nothing good to say and left to work for twitch. theyve sold/terminated leases on a huge chunk of their offices in palo alto and instituted an equity buy-back plan since there are issues retaining people with useless shares and impossible exit scenarios associated with raising massive amounts of money. not to mention you are getting paid something like 70% what you would elsewhere (at least a few years ago, there was a 130k salary cap on all employees).
13
i had the oddest experience with palantir. a recruiter reached out on linkedin and asked me if i wanted to interview. i said sure, and we set up a date and time. were going back and forth over email the whole time leading up to the interview. interview time comes and...nothing. no call. i email the recruiter and only get a response of "im sorry to inform you but you are no longer being considered for the position." and that was that. it was so strange. from getting recruited to rejected in 3 days.
11
> this made me seriously consider though, how does palantir get good talent if they have such a horrible recruiting process?they might have a much slimmer recruiting process for people who are warmly recommended by employees or manages who already work for palantir. at least thats often the case (though typically not formalized) at big organizations with complicated processes.
10
it definitely says something if you were able to secure an internship at google, which historically has had a notoriously lengthy interview process, before palantir.
6
not here to tell you that the process is good - its not; or that its worth it - that depends on your other options. ive worked at palantir for a bit over 2 years mid-career, it was worth at least 5 or 7 years in experience. average caliber of people is very high, and you get a lot of responsibility quickly if youre able to handle it. exactly 1 month in i was presenting to a fortune 500 ceo. i triple wished palantir was my first job coming out of college. source: former palantir employee, left on good terms.
16
cool name. palantir means "far-seer" in quenya. but, in the hands of the steward denethor it was only a tool for his corruption and demise.
21
i avoided palantir at the career fair for this reason. its packed every time and i wonder why kids try there after all the shitty things we hear about then.
12
> i wholeheartedly regret even starting this process of applying to palantir as its been a huge time and energy investmentim sure you learned a few things, dusted up on some skills, practiced interviewing, etc. this will make future interviews feel like a breeze. i wouldnt say it was a waste of your energy.
8
out of all the companies ive interviewed with over the years, palantir was the worst experience by far. incredibly long process, aggressive/rude interviewers (in my experience at least), and the unusual vagueness of the entire internship as well was definitely a huge turn off. i will not be reapplying there anytime soon. its reassuring to hear others have had similar experiences as well
3
back when i was applying for internships, palantir stood out as the most unprofessional out of all of them. my recruiter forgot to call me for my interview and never apologized for it. he never even admitted to the fact that he had forgotten to call me and he just shrugged it off. i tried calling him but he didnt answer until much later, but in the end i am glad i never got past the first round of interviews (even though i did well in all the questions).
4
i interviewed at palantir d.c and while i expected the interviews to be challenging they did a whole bunch of stuff that annoyed me/felt unfair. the non-technical hiring manager sat in on all of my whiteboard interviews, which were already taking place in small glass offices where anyone walking by could see us. it just made it harder to concentrate. i had i think 4 or 5 technical interviews with different people and i never got a lunch or snack break, even though i talked to some of the other candidates that were there that day and they did. i just assumed after every interview someone would take me to lunch but nope the next question just immediately started. by the 4th question i could barely think straight. what makes it really wtf material is the hiring manager was in the room with me the whole time...

op, you have character defects that disqualify you from palantir.  you have integrity, are honest and hardworking.  also, you lack innate authoritarianism that would motivate you to torture others who apply behind you at that company.congratulations.
6
>this made me seriously consider though, how does palantir get good talent if they have such a horrible recruiting process?excess supply vs small demand
2
i dont know much about palantir if im being honest, but if theyve interviewed you that much and still cant determine whether youre a good fit or not, then theyre not very good at interviewing. just like when courting people for a relationship, at some point you have to make the commitment and decide. otherwise you just come across as not wanting to put forth any risk, while the other person is dicked around.
2
>i wholeheartedly regret even starting this process of applying to palantir as its been a huge time and energy investment and i have absolutely no closure--i didnt get rejected, i didnt get an offer, i just walked away.  while i know anyone in your case would be frustrated, youll look back at be able to look at this situation in a different light. im sure youve learned a lot in this situation, you just havent used it yet.
2
so im late to the game but i have one question, who are palantir?  maybe im a bit out of touch but seriously never heard of them.
2
palantir is about as opaque as you can get. im a current college sophomore, i know plenty of sophomores who have gotten interviews and even intern offers. however, the first thing the recruiter lady hits me with is "sorry we are looking for juniors only". i already have experience at two of the big 4 companies and was expecting at least a first round interview. thankfully didnt bother with them this year and am going to a far better company this summer. their offshoot company addepar is no better: i had a first round there and the engineer doing the interview expressed that i was one of the best intern candidates hes seen this season. addepar rejects me afterward, most likely due to all spots being filled. they have a small intern class of about 8 every summer, and i get that. however i would have appreciated some honesty, something along the lines of: "hey we dont have any more spots this year but well get you interview next summer". in all honesty palantir and addepar are just more examples of stanford country clubs; they survive off wealthy investors and powerful connections.
2
ive also seen a lot of similar experiences (i started microsoft in july and didnt finish that until the start of december, and some the security companies especially have dreadfully slow processes) but my experience with palantir, while involving the most onsite interviews, wrapped up in a month and was completely molded around my schedule, which made it as convenient as flying away could have been.i didnt get the bait and switch, though, i know that would have immediately put me off if i had, and the glassdoor especially is filled with cases where people have had that happen which is unsettling. i know theyre trying to fill a less desirable role, but its incredibly unfair to the interviewee not to be upfront about it and wait until youve invested time and tasted the kool-aid a little.

itt: a bunch of people who dont know anything about palantir but acting like they do ...

palantir already does not have tech talent because they have no use for itall they need is massive corruption and illegal preferential treatment from the governmentedit: i guess if ur actually dumb enough to apply there youre exactly the kind of person theyre looking for
6
> during this time i also found two separate internships, one at a breakout list company and another at google. i took both offers (i had two off terms from school essentially) and am currently working at the breakout list company. yet, here i am in january talking to palantir still and being asked to do more interviews. finally i said enough, no tech internship could possibly be worth what would be 8 interviews or more if i kept going.not surprised. peter theil owns it. and looks like they are doing every single thing on this list:forbes: ["10 kinds of abuse no job-seeker should tolerate"](http://www3.forbes.com/leadership/10-kinds-of-abuse-no-job-seeker-should-tolerate)

someone i know had a similarly hideous experience.this person was a 4.0 gpa cs major at a top school, finishing a masters in ca specializing in data science, with a history of great prior internships.  i would have thought this would be exactly the profile that someone like palantir was looking for.  but apparently that isnt enough.  it is necessary to torture the person.after endless bs i recommended that he/she drop out of the process and pointed out that one of two things would happen.a) there would be no feedbackb) someone would reach out from palantir and ask whyimho if there is no followup the culture is f*d up, because you cant have a process where super talented people drop out and not know why.sure enough, no followup.  they have a messed up recruitment process.

could it be possible, considering the clients palantir has, that a secret security check (performed somehow with the help of the security agencies) could be a deciding factor in getting accepted there?

i have never interviewed at palantir... but all i hear is a frustrated guy who didnt make the cut.youre only doing a second round of interviews, because you didnt make it the first round, so they thought another (less-skillful) team could be a fit.> how does palantir get good talent if they have such a horrible recruiting process?there is a fallacy in this saying. its making an unproven assumption that you==toptalent

slashdot had an interesting discussion on this over here:https://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=9703199&cid=52966963https://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=9703199&cid=52968499basically, theres a huge influx of chinese job applicants that fail a background check due to direct or indirect but obvious ties to the chinese government.  these arent always immigrants, often second or third generation chinese americans with family still in china that they can be blackmailed with.  when these are weeded out, you see the kind of numbers palantir has -- but theyre not allowed to state this publicly due to homeland security (you cant openly state "oh yeah, we had to weed out x number of applicants because china was trying to get spies in our company.")
204
so theres this company called palantir that does data analysis, and totally isnt related to the artefacts in lotr compromised by sauron that almost won him the war because he used them to send in faulty intel, and the us government is complaining that there arent enough chinese people in it.i really dont know how i could think of a situation that better describes "asking for it".
11
>in one example, palantir hired 14 non-asians and 11 asian candidates from a pool of 1160 qualified people, 85 percent of whom were asiansomething like 40% hired for a population that is about 6% in overall population? that sounds highly overrepresented relative to population. but how nice to hear the overall application demographics matter. so, say 90% of applicants in gaming areas are white males, 90% white males in the field is no problem right?
13
ive got nothing to add to this discussion, gut **goddamn** palantir is such a great name for a company anything really
3
few thoughts. a) i would never work there. b) cia level background checks are intense. they ask for a deep family history, employment history, they send out people to check 2nd and 3rd degree contacts. c) palantir... they need to hire more korean staff, because their starcraft team in ahgl needed to get beefed up more.

peter thiel named his company palantir, what a nerd (love it).

umm...they werent hiring asians...because they believed they would be security risks? >as davislane1 suggested, its national security, and the chinese of all countries are a legitimate issue moving forward. thats incredibly racist. >in one example, palantir hired 14 non-asians and 11 asian candidates from a pool of 1160 qualified people, 85 percent of whom were asian. the lawsuit says the possibility this happened by chance is one in 3.4 million. the ofccp said it contacted palantir before the filing to try and resolve the issues, but the company declined to comply, leading to the department of labor launching the lawsuit.the dol should absolutely take them to court.
-7
as someone who works in tech, palantir seems to be offering something akin to splunk. in other words, it isnt a tool to facilitate the clandestine gathering of data, but rather for interpreting the massive amount of data that intelligence agencies have been accumulating. for non techies, splunk is a tool that sucks up data from whatever source you point at it. so i can have my firewalls dumping syslogs to it alongside the sysadmins servers and whatever else we want. when an issue crops up, we can elegantly query this data in splunk and visualize it to make it easier to interpret and correlate.an extremely powerful tool, yes; but in and of itself, it doesnt seem to be a violation of civil liberties. the data is the problem, not the tool.
