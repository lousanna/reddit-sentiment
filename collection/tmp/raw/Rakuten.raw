rakuten own the japanese club vissel kobe, nice to see a change from barca.id imagine they would go with just the company name over their ["r" design](http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_gold/soccershop/item/xs003x-vk23.jpg)or the [kanji version](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sj20130209a1a-870x396.jpg)

mikitani is a f hypocrite. his company discriminates against people with disabilities and diseases.when i did job hunting in japan i never ever encounter any company that wanted to know if i had some kind of disability or disease except for rakuten. guess what, after i disclose to them what i have they suddenly send me this "thank you but you have not passed our selection" email. ha!
