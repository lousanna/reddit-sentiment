apa kabar! i used to live in jakarta for 8 years, i work in singapore now. i was in sephora last weekend and was looking at some urban decay eye primers when some indonesian ibu ibu turned up with a long list of stuff. i think they bought 7 of the naked pallets and a bunch of other stuff, there are going to be some very happy girls in indoensia!

halo fellow indonesian, apa kabar? :)i know benefits getting to be really big there! i think if sephora is going to open more stores, online shop sales may suffer a bit. most of my makeup savvy friends over there purchase from olshops. sleek palettes are popular, and im pretty sure theyre legit. not sure of the markup though.

if you are willing to take a trip to singapore they have a couple sephoras there.

if they have the opi by sephora uv effects top coat, buy it! its so fun, glows in black light and makes normal polishes more vibrant.

im so jealous! they used to carry pupa years ago in sephora in the u.s. i love their packaging!

ive noticed that individual brands will offer deeper xmas discounts (25-30%) than the sephora 20%, but its harder to find ways to meet the 50 free shipping minimum, so your savings level out as shipping costs. with sephora its easier to make the savings count because the selection is wider and shipping costs arent a concern.

i almost never buy makeup online (apart from the odd indie product) because i live within walking distance of a sephora and several department stores and drugstores. earlier this year, i came close to ordering something from clinique.ca because i couldnt find the product i wanted in stores and i was really impressed by their gwps. right now they have a "get 6 free minis with any purchase" deal. not something i plan to take advantage of anytime soon, but definitely way more than youd get for buying the same product at sephora.

well, occasionally you can find decent sales, especially around the holidays. even "high end" brands. i recently got 20% off from ysls website, got a perfume for my sister and an engraved lipstick for my cousin (engraving was free, not sure if that was part of the sale or if it always is), plus free shipping. tom ford rarely has sales but has free shipping on every order. got 20% off on koh gen dos us website. armani often has 15 or 20% off sales as well. im also a fan of a few website that arent individual companies but also arent sephora or ulta. i think most people know about beautylish and dermstore, but they generally have great customer service and fast shipping. i also like ordering from neiman marcus, they dont always have sales but they frequently have awesome gwps and also always send 5 samples. the samples are usually awesome too. hakuhodos us website is great...well its kind of a confusing page and a bit overwhelming, but their customer service is great and very responsive, they will answer any questions you have, and their shipping is very fast.

generally, general retailers have better shipping rates (if not free shipping), faster turnaround time and much better ecommerce experience. the websites of sephora and beautylish are more polished and responsive to users than say, those of inglot or cinema secrets.ive shared some experiences below.**mass retailer:*** beautylish: exceptional customer service and insanely fast shipping times. ive gotten packages in less than 24 hours (granted i live close to one of their dispatch locations). amazing packaging that usually comes with branded wrapping paper and a handwritten note. for purchases over 100, you can split payment into three interest-free installments. phenomenal website where you can clearly see purchase history, easily add reviews, and track packages very accurately. no sales, unless you call that black friday bioderma event a sale. one of my absolute favorite retailers. **individual companies:*** cinema secrets: shopped their black friday sale. had i spent the 75 for their free shipping discount, their 40% off sale would have been a real steep discount. however they have sliding scale shipping for purchases under the minimum, so really the discount just covered shipping for the two items i purchased. items shipped in secure packages within a week and nothing arrived broken. * inglot: i bought during their black friday sale, spending 50 to get the free shipping. there was a gift with purchase! i got a nail polish and a freedom system lipstick. items took nine days to deliver. i contacted customer service to cancel a previous order and they responded the next day and canceled the charge, so i was happy with my experience.

my order from sephora came in on schedule as promised. i dont think i waited for any discounts to appear or anything, so i dont know what waiting around would do - although it did sign me up for the e-mails everyone gets, which is kinda nice. i probably should have looked to see if there was a free gift, too, but i was too focused on completing my order lmao.signing up with nyx, colourpop, and the balm gave me discounts (and possible wet n wild too? wnw is so cheap anyways). i ended up ordering from colourpop and the balm and they both did not add tax, and the balm had free shipping. (this was so nice - i was so tempted to go out to kohls and buy full price + tax)colourpop gave me 5 off, which is decent considering that is basically a free product. theyve also been doing a lot of deals lately where you get a free product for every 10. i wouldnt be surprised if this continued through the holidays. the balm only gave me 10% off, which isnt as decent as their flash sales or their discounts on hautelook.i have had some stuff in my cart on mac and makeup geek, and they dont really send me e-mails to try to get me to buy it. nyx has encouraged me to check out and complete my order, though (but not with any additional discounts).i ordered from colourpop on saturday, and its supposed to arrive tomorrow. i dont know when i technically ordered from the balm, but its technically a christmas gift, so i doubt my parents will let me know when it comes in. ive already got the shipping notice, though.tl;dr: if you sign up for a brands newsletters, and order directly, theres some chance for coupons, free shipping, tax included in price, etc. its worth a shot to me. even though they might be behind due to the holidays, i havent experienced anything negative. ymmv. the advantage to sephora / ulta is stock + shipping time, and maybe coupons you already have.edit: i havent had any issues with powders coming in broken before, but how a brand handles that is definitely something you should research, as i feel like customer service varies wildly. also, my colourpop order is arriving today after all, which is really impressive! so i think thats another expectation that can vary a lot!

ive ordered from two brands web sites: occ and too faced.too faced was relatively fast (nothing to write home about, but not excruciatingly slow), but i noticed that the first time i ordered, i got a fun pink box with that stuff you put in easter baskets, but then the second time i ordered, it was a plain brown box with just the bag inside. it felt a little sad, not getting that cute little box again.i ordered from occ a couple of years in a pretty chill time--no big sales, no holidays around the corner, nothing--and it still took a solid four or five days for the order to process. it was shipped via usps, which wouldnt be a big deal for me since it would just be from nyc to where i live in upstate ny (usually takes two days, tops), but it managed to take another four days to get here. also, since it was an in-state transaction for me, i got charged sales tax. ugh.meanwhile, sephora and ulta are pretty standard. the only gripes i have are when they use that service where it goes ups up until your closest post office, and the usps finishes it off...always adds an extra day or two to my package. plus, if i dont like what i get, i can bring it to a store to return rather than trying to figure out how to return from the brands website.

i live in a fairly remote location, to the point where going out and buying expensive make up is a trip that takes out whole day. (though it wont be for much longer, our local jcp is getting a sephora come april...) i ended up getting an account with sephora because of sephora and ulta, there is a sephora within an hour and a half distance, while the closest ulta is 3 hours from me. i usually shop with sephora now because my mom and i tend to co-order on my account, so its very easy to get free shipping between the pair of us.

i hate shipping costs and heaven forbid i cant use it, i have to pay for someone to take it back to them. so its not a gamble i am willing to take.atleast with sephora and ulta, i can just take it in to them and return it
