hillary clinton is in support of selling out the american people to big corporations and supports many of the policies that democrats claimed to be against. the woman is basically a republican except when it comes to social issues. quite frankly, in my view the focus on many vapid social issues (ie: starbucks cup) is what is crippling the country.  i remember democrats wanted george w. bush trialed for patriot act, now they cheer on hillarys support of it. i remember how people crucified mitt romneys ties to wall street, now they applaud hillary for getting their support. what a joke.

actual headline: "a review of superpac donations finds that pretty much every other superpac is in violation of the same rules"    of course, the hill knows better than anyone how much extra traffic they will get by writing a headline which makes it seem like this is a  hillary clinton exclusive.

**hillegal**contrary to or forbidden by law, though because of the political standing of the perpetrator, the action is downplayed and no punishment is enacted.**edit**: come on now, what makes you all assume that the *hill* in "hillegal" refers to hillary clinton and not the the hill political website? there must be something that makes you draw that connection.
