9237
i used to work for comcast, and we used this case as a study. the trainer basically said that it was a reflection of how people felt about the company. its comcastic!
2183
>after the story about her exploits ran, the charges were dropped.so comcast is so unpopular that a prosecutor cant try and convict someone who gets fed up and takes a hammer to their customer service center.
1051
its why all the comcast offices in chicago have more bullet proof glass and security than any bank i have ever been to.
179
> she went to the office to speak to a manager, comcast had her wait two hours and the manager left for the day. god this infuriates me just reading about it.
97
oh, thats mona. shes such a nice lady. i went to congregation with her. she has this tiny hammer pin she wears on her clothes sometimes. :) we never mentioned we worked at comcast. ever.
144
not surprising, given the horror stories about comcast. its like they actively try to cultivate their reputation as the worst company for customer service in america.
164
i just cancelled comcast today!!! it was suprisingly easy and i couldnt be happier, fuck that shitty company, the monthly bill was outrageous
92
i went to a comcast customer service center recently and those employees are more protected than most banks ive seen. thick bullet proof glass and one way drop boxes. then again, there were a lot of blatantly pissed off people in that place. super nasty mean people openly insulting the staff and acting crazy. i never want to go back.
12
as a brit - can anyone eli5 reddits hatred towards comcast, i feel it may help a lot....
12
the problem with comcasts customer service is that they seem to keep all their information in separate data centers and offices. this is what seems to happen when you try to sign up for service:* the household office gets a fax, which they manually type into their database.* the person office gets an automated printout telling them to call you.* the device registry office is different for every single region. so in some places, the device registry office is automated, while in other places, its manned by a single it guy who types in all the device info into a crappy windows 3.1 program and hopes it doesnt crash when he saves it.* the director of the billing office secretly hates all the other offices, and hopes that one day he can conquer them and eat their budgets.
27
it honestly surprises me there arent more incidents like this (or worse) with the shitty customer service these companies provide.p.s. fuck comcast.
36
the trick is to go to the local comcast office. the people you talk to on the phone dont even work for comcast. theyre some kind of 3rd party call center that comcast contracts out to.
17
haha! the last bit. "to tell you the truth i have more problems with verizon than i did comcast"
4
i would drop the charges if i were da. comcast deserves it. =p

part of me loves the fact that she obviously has some deep frustration and hatred for comcast at times but still pays for the service.  "i hate you!!""so....youre saying youd like xfinity internet for 39.99/mo for 6 months?""i fucking hate you!!""alrighty maam, well get you signed up today."
3
the daily comcast sucks circlejerk. featuring such comments as:  how are they still in business?!  i just cancelled my service last week!  comcast cant keep getting away with this!  no but seriously, we know they suck.
5
i love how even the mod seems fed up with the comcast posts
4
if this was a 25-year-old black dude smashing up a mcdonalds, reddit would have been calling him worse than shit. but a little old lady doing the same thing to comcast? yeah, apparently thats fine. think about it. the people who work in the comcast store are just trying to do their job and then some fucking nutjob old lady starts smashing the place up with a hammer. they probably thought she was going to attack them too. i used to be a bookie, and we had a few people smash the place up ([it happens all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh7pjfkokf4)). its scary as fuck. anyone who is unhinged enough to commit criminal damage in the middle of a store is unhinged enough to attack the staff. worst of all, this womans 95-year-old mother had to pay her expensive legal bills to keep her retarded ass out of prison.
6
my wife handles the comcast bill and it goes up each month for no reason prompting her to call and get it adjusted.  needless to say she yells expletives every month she sees the new bill.  i can see her going hammer-time when she reaches 30+ years of dealing with comcast.
2
the comcast offices i have been to are like banks.  everyone is behind glass...now i know why.
2
i always hear people complaining about comcast and twc. but in australia, telstra is as big as or more of a scumbag than those two companies.
2
she has verizon for the telephone service and comcast for the internet. sledgehammer
2
the trick is to go to the local comcast office. the people you talk to on the phone dont even work for comcast. theyre some kind of 3rd party call center that comcast contracts out to.
2
i would believe this because its comcast.
2
she trashed a comcast office with a hammer?if reddit somehow learns that this lady also supports bernie sanders, the entire community is going to have a collective screaming orgasm!
2
looks like she declared /r/waroncomcast

i live in the san jose area and google fiber is trying to set things up for us. guess who is trying to prevent them from using the utility poles in some south bay cities? http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_29625647/google-fights-at-t-comcast-over-google-fiber
2
am i allowed to say *this is awesome*?  or would that be against the rules? if every comcast customer did this, perhaps wed get somewhere?
2
til to old people comcast is a phone company...
2
dae comcast is bad??
6
no matter your feelings towards comcast, this is ridiculous and should never be praised. the question isnt whether their customer service is terrible enough to incite destructive rage, but what is wrong with this woman that she cant control herself when getting angry.
13
so... she acts like an asshole, changes nothing, and is treated like a hero?how about instead of feeling vindicated that someone assaulted an office full of workers that have no real say in how comcast runs their business, we elect leaders who dont treat the word "regulations" like some sort of taboo?
2
>dae comcast is evil, again omgwtfbbq frontpage?oh mods, i love you. :)
5
if comcast lost a penny for every unsatisfied captive customer* they would cease to exist. * sadly comcast is not considered a monopoly !
3
>her celebrity began when comcast couldnt provide her steady service of its triple play option, which combined phone, cable and internet service. after the shaws many complaints, comcast cut off service entirely. she went to the office to speak to a manager, comcast had her wait two hours and the manager left for the day.so they fail to give the service she paid for, then just completely cut her service after she complained about it, then had her sit two hours to wait for the manager who then decided to leave for the day?if at that point you dont feel like taking a hammer to the customer service center, you must be a zen master.
2
a hammer-shaped lapel pin and people wore shirts with the logo?? sounds like a modern day granny on fire to me! time to start the trilogy. first comcast followed by verizon then maybe a cox 2-parter!
2
the instant another option for internet becomes available, i will drop comcast so hard. google fiber is supposedly coming to nashville and i cant contain my excitement. i dont even care if its somehow worse than comcast - the sweet, sweet retribution of their empire of terror hurtling towards a terrible destruction will be more than enough reason to do it.
2
awww mona! shes a super nice lady. just really frustrated by her experience with comcast. i got to deal with the fallout from this when i worked there.
2
strange logic.destroy property over petty shit and get a free trip with a limo and hotel stay.i hate comcast as much as the next person, but stooping to something childish shouldnt be rewarded.
3
lmao at the mod who put that tag dae comcast is evil
2
i must live in a parallel dimension. my local comcast office runs like a bank. ive never waited more than 10 minutes for service, and have never left without being able to do what i came in for. i cancelled cable tv a while ago and kept my internet service. they do call once in a while to try to tempt me with discounted premium channels and gift cards, but other than that theyre as good a provider as any.
1
comcast really fucks with their customers with prices, but if you are willing to spend an hour talking to customer retention every few months you can get your cost cut in half.it basically cost them nothing to give an individual service. so they will take  50 over nothing. i told them 70 is all i can pay for internet and tv. the bill at the time was 140. i threatened to cancel the tv because i dont watch, then they offered be this "special bundle" where i keep all the same services and just pay 70.
1
just get century link for your internet and save yourself the hassle. they honestly are incredibly responsive and always take care of me when i have an issue. will never switch to comcast or verizon, period.
1
i used to live in shreveport, louisiana and comcast was the only game in town. we had so much trouble out of them when we lived there. im talking about we had to have 4 cable boxes replaced within a years time (through no fault of our own...manufacture date on most of them was 1996). what is interesting is that the comcast store where we would visit had 3 inch thick bulletproof glass in front of the reps. it was a mad house in there, too, because everyone inside was upset. now we live in tennessee and while comcast is currently our only option, google fibers availability is quickly approaching and we cant wait to switch.
1
verizon and comcast compete against each other in my town and i almost never had issues with fios. if i do, there is a verizon store 10 minutes away unlike comcast where the closest one is over 30mins away. maybe i am just lucky that verizon isnt shit in my area.
1
>i have fewer problems with comcast than i do with verizonwell, yeah. i would provide exemplary service to someone who once threatened me with a hammer, too.
1
the only problem i have with comcast is the price.  internet is fast and never goes down.  the new xfinity remote controls are cool.  no, im not a hired hack from comcast....
1
the thing is, this is literally the only way to disincentivize a monopoly from pushing customer satisfaction so low with no punitive effects to their bottom line...cuz theyre a monopoly.  maybe the government sanctioned regional monopolies should have no protection of the law for property damage.  if they want people to behave, they have to treat them like a threat.  no this doesnt protect the lowest workers of the agency, whom the monopoly would hire as meatshields for their investment.  but those people can smash the company up just as much, from the inside.  so comcast is incentivized to take care of them.
1
good. fuck comcast and their gutter company. what the fuck is up with sending me mail every other day? and the mail is disguised! every time its something different. a bright orange letter that says fragile, a checkered letter that says contains important billing information. that shit has to be crossing legal boundaries.
1
so glad i live in a city where where we have isps other than comcast/at&t/verizon/<insert other big name corrupt corporation>.we have local isps which provide wayy better service, and at significantly lower costs.(i live in san francisco and my isp is monkeybrains.)
1
well can i hardly judge anyone for what they do on a comcast induced rage.
1
i like this and i like this lady. we should have a public fund for people who have broken the law and been punished when it was in fact the right thing to do. if more of us were smashing up comcast buildings, perhaps theyd change.
1
to bad gravity hammers arent real because comcast should get hit with one of those.
1
shes not the customer comcast needs, but shes the customer they deserve.
1
pro-tip: when youre trying to cancel with a cable company, tell them youre moving somewhere where they dont offer service. theyll take care of business quickly and wont try their endless tricks to retain you because its pointless.i had no issues quickly cancelling comcast by telling them i was moving to upstate ny, and once i was in upstate ny i had no problem cancelling time warner telling them i was moving to st louis.
1
ive never had dealings with comcast but ive seen so much hate for them on here. circle jerk even got the swastika onto the google image after searching comcast. can someone tell me why theyre so bad?
1
after an hour of catching up, there is only one question left. who is your cable and internet service provider these days?a pause. she clears her throat.she has verizon for the telephone service and comcast for the internet. "to tell you the truth, i have fewer problems with comcast than i do with verizon.
1
sounds like the war on comcast just found its william wallace.
1
can we organize a national smash your local comcast store window with a hammer day?
1
maybe its local, but where i live, time warner cable is the evil empire of isps. i suppose comcast really doesnt count because its an amalgamation of numerous different corporate entities, but ive never once heard anyone speak ill of cc because they simply dont cause problems in this neck of the woods.oh, and like majority of the country, we also get burned by the two or three corporations that own, like, 99% of radio stations in the u.s.
1
am i the only person in the world thats never had an issue with comcast? ive had them for years without a problem.
1
i mean, have you ever dealt with comcast customer service? this seems like a pretty reasonable response.
1
comcast is the devil.
1
i mean we all know comcast sucks, but this lady is fucking nuts.
1
her last name is shaw? thats an internet/cable/satellite service provider here in canada. "shaw hammers comcast" is just weird to me though.
1
seriously though, why the fuck are we encouraging people to go tear up waiting rooms? this not only is an inconvenience to the innocent people in the waiting room, but doesnt target the real problem. all it does is fuck with the lives of employees who have no real responsibility for comcasts actions. violence needs direction and purpose to be effective, and she doesnt have either. now, if she took a hammer to the cars of the board, executives, and division managers then she would have both. alternatively, she could just smash up something of her own in front of comcast to send her point. this...is dumb. not that ive never done anything dumb out of anger, but people usually let me know so yea.
1
waiting to see a shooter at comcasts offices.i dont want to. but im waiting.
1
i was trying to comment sooner but my comcast cut out.
5019
my hate for comcast is so thick and rich you could drizzle it over pancakes.
296
i just ordered comcasts most popular bundle service, internet/cable/unlubracated anal rape. they said it was 69.99 but they have billed me for 154.99 and havent delivered on the cable or internet.
220
right before christmas, my internet went out. turns out comcast deleted my account by accident, they never gave me the details to why / how. spent over 4 hours on the phone getting my internet service back online. at one point, my internet traffic wasnt being allowed past their captive portal. the technician (from a call center in asia) put me on hold, then transferred me to an arris technician state side. the conversation started with him trying to get my consent to bill me for support (60 bucks), it turned into a dick measuring contest with me, refusing to give him consent, walking him thru how i got there and explaining that i probably know more than he does about this stuff (strong embedded linux systems experience) and my modem isnt broken. he finally gave up on billing me and agreed that comcast is not doing something correctly.as a comcast customer, i shouldnt have had to make this phone call and go thru a dick measuring competition.
247
i actually like the service they provide. no problem there. cable is reliable, internet is fast. its the shady pricing and comically bad customer service that eats away at my soul."okay you are locked in at xxx.xx a month for two years."two months later my bill is 10 dollars higher. "that is a service charge for your hd boxes that wasnt originally calculated."4 months later my bill is 50 dollars higher. "im not sure who you spoke with 6 months prior sir but we have no record of you being quoted at that price."one month my bank attached to my credit card on file took an extra day to clear so they had me owing double and shut my cable off and then charged me a reconnection fee.that right there is why people hate comcast.
288
in the words of everyone else in the country that isnt a comcast employee:>"no fucking shit."maybe if we could get some actual regulation on this trust of a company, then we could have decent fucking internet service.
80
thanks to the nightmare comcast business put me through i realized i dont need a phone for my business (they never put my listing in phonebooks or the web, so no calls from customers, but they did sell my listing to telemarketers around the world and gave me a phone number from someone who owed everybody money, including comcast, so one of the first calls i got was a robocall from them demanding payment) and i dont need internet. i made an antenna after watching a youtube vid. and get a better picture and i like the programming better than cable. saved a closed to 5,000 in just a few years.
103
comcast once tried to get me to pay for another account who was using my ssn. wrong name, wrong birthday, same ssn. they said since its my ssn i have to pay it.lets just say it didnt work out for comcast.
25
comcast? never heard of it, you must be thinking of that great new isp xfinity, everyone loves them, right?
118
comcast dropped a 1tb monthly data cap unexpectedly on my area back in november. i found out about it last month when we had a service outage (standard service outage, nothing related to the data cap), and i was checking my account to see whether theyd failed (again) to notify me thered been a problem with their billing system and my account wasnt paid up to date.1tb is more than i tend to use in a month. but still, data caps are getting pushed through. and i dont have any other companies to run to, so i cant exactly just tell comcast to fuck themselves like id like.
44
well i live about 30 mins outside comcast coverage so i have only the option of tds telecom. their prices are okay. but every month the city digs out the ditches. i live on a dirt road. tds decided to lay their line right next to the ditch. so every month for the past 5 months they have to come out and lay a new line because the other one gets dug up.  and as i watch them i cant help but feel like im watching the special needs student of the class doing his best.
63
comcast collections called me last year, a year and a half after closing my account, telling me i owed them money for a router i had already returned when the account was closed. i flipped out so hard on the phone that they actually just dropped it entirely, apologized, and i never heard from them again.im a very, very satisfied verizon customer now.
70
congratulations comcast!
18
if every person thats spent at least 40 minutes on the phone with comcast getting the "runaround" liked this i would have 15,000 votes...no joke.
50
i recently moved into a comcast area and its pretty fucking awful. i get 50-something shit channels (lots of weird shit ive never heard of before like "the justice channel" and old 50s tv show channels) and 30mpbs/down with a tb cap for 80 a month. i got unlimited 300mbps/down from suddenlink for 95 a month!i couldnt even get a quote for service without giving them my address, and the salesperson tried to get me to give them my ssn! why would they need my social to get a service quote? i can understand some packages arent available in all areas but for fucks sake, if they werent so focused on hitting their sales numbers and more focused on customer experience people might hate them less.
65
post about how comcast sucks? see you at the front page.
34
ive had relatively few issues with comcasts product. i canceled tv service and only use them for voip and internet. they didnt give me a hard time about canceling that part of my package, said they understood, and have randomly increased my internet speed to 200mbps without an upcharge. their customer service was fine, and is usually fine when i need to talk to them. maybe im in the minority.
7
3 worst companies:comcast, monsanto, goldman sachs
7
do yourselves a favor. just get 1tb of internet a month through comcast for 80 monthtly, if comcast is your only provider. buy a kodi streaming android box on ebay for 170. i did this and save 960 a year on cable.
17
why doesnt my apartment building in washington, dc have fios? im forced to use comcast. i recently canceled my cable but i still have to use them for internet unless i go dsl. i called verizon to ask why, and was told fios is not currently available in your building. yeah, i already knew that, thats why im calling....comcasat customer service around the cancel and returning of the cable box and cable card has been . . . problematic and i still havent fully resolved the issues. i gave up and am waiting to see what happens.
3
the only positive experience ive had with comcast was this year, on new years day, where i called to upgrade my internet speed (as they hadnt been giving the speed i have been paying for, despite multiple complaints and call attempts), and i managed to get what seemed like a native, or at least fluent, english speaker, and was able to get the speed upgraded to what it should be, and get some of the extra charges added as a credit to my bill with just a 10 minute phone call and a router reset. i was genuinely ecstatic at this result, as ive never had a less-than-2-hour call to comcast prior to this.
3
"fuck comcast", i say through my vpn, which i only bought after they gave me shit about my downloads supposedly violating copyright laws.
18
dammit, should i seriously cancel the comcast service i just signed up for after leaving at&t then? im moving to royal oak, mi and i chose comcast for the 150 mbps internet only plan. feedback anyone please?
3
my comcast experience: i live in an in-law apartment, and pay comcast for their 190mbps service.  my landlords after 4 months think weve been using *their* wifi the whole time (they didnt mind, but they asked if we were downloading constantly because it was slow for them) turns out our friends at comcast  just installed a spittler to the one main line coming into the house. so were paying for 2 seperate sevices, but the bandwidth is capped on one line. so when im downloading a 60gb game from steam, it makes my landlords internet also come to a gridning halt. fuckin twats. this shit still isnt resolved.
3
where i live comcast is my only cable internet option, so i pretty much have to go with them if i want any type of decent internet. they called me the other day asking if i wanted to take a survey. i laughed and said sure."on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being completely unhappy, how satisfied with comcast are you?""1, theyre my only option so i have to have them""on a scale of 0-10 how likely are you to suggest comcast to friends or family?""0, i would tell them to stay as far away as they could""on a scale of 1-10, if another attractive offer popped up in your area, how likely would you be to stay with comcast?""0, id be out in a split second if anything else was available""sir, its on a scale of 1-10""still a 0"
3
ama from former or current comcast employee on how they are trained to fuck us all?
3
the republicans want to structure healthcare like cable, so id expect comcast will lose the title soon.
3
their customer support constantly tries to sell me shit when im telling them their billing me too much. i have given up on trying to get my bill to the right amount & my apartment is comcast exclusive so i cant do anything about it.
3
this news is not all that surprising, and aftet years of this being true ive come to the conclusion that they really dont give a shit.  most americans, such as myself, are stuck with comcast because it is literally the only internet provider available in my building.[negan talking about comcasts stance on its customer service policy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb40ooridgc) nsfw
6
which is weird, ive never had issues with my comcast internet or tv, works like a charm. sure theres the occasional outage, but literally every company has those. in my experience, the internet you get with directtv (think its century link now or something) is complete fucking ass, highest speed you can get is like 16 mb/s for the same price you can get 60 mb/s from comcast.
4
their call center customer service is beyond horrific. moved a couple of years ago and switched service to my new house. i told the girl on the phone i still had a week before i moved. she said it wouldnt be a problem and said the new place was already equipped with their service. woke up the next morning to no internet and no phone. so, i called and they told me the girl had put an order in for immediate disconnection and they couldnt reverse it, but it was okay because service was ready to go at the new house.we move in. no phone. no internet. no cable. comcast was never set up at the house. the former owners had direct tv. so, i call and they set me up for a service visit. the person tells me that someone will be out in two days between blah and blah. no one ever comes. i call again. turns out the person i spoke with put the visit two months out and the person i was speaking with said they couldnt send anyone out sooner. pissed off, i hung up and went to their center which was damn near an hour away. containing my anger to the best of my abilities, i calmly explained everything that had transpired over the past two weeks. they apologized profusely and fixed everything. they sent someone out within an hour at no charge and knocked a hundred bucks off my bill.took a couple of months for me to see one of those "moving with comcast is easy" commercials and not yell "fuck you" at my television.
2
verizon is quickly gaining on them. you better pick up the pace comcast, youve got competition!
2
theres a company moving into my suburb and laying down fiber.  i already let my wife know when they are available we are dropping every comcast service we have and going to that for data and our attic antenna for tv.  what finally made me say no more to comcast...data caps.  we average 200gb of data a month and once they announce if you use more than 1 tb of data they will start charging you more and our data use suddenly doubles?  what!  please explain comcast?  sure theyll explain if you dont mind sitting on hold for 30 minutes, and then the person you talk to sounds like someone who doesnt have a high school diploma and has no idea what data even is...
2
for good reason. our service was down off and on (mostly off) for three days. finally called the service department, they "ran some tests" then decided they needed to do another that would take 15 minutes at which time they would call us back. never heard back.so, i called again the next day. the non-english speaking person on their end decided we needed to have a tech come to the house. he set the appointment. once we got of the phone i checked my email. he had set the appointment for a completely different day and time. : 2 days later. later that night our service came back up and was still up when i went to bed.... and the next day... and the day after. i decided to cancel the appointment. texted "noappt" to comcast. their response "there are no appointments scheduled for your account. please call 1-800-xfinity"blargllglrlgrhlgr!
2
comcast called me about the "specials" they had available. the cheapest one they had was 30 more than what i currently have and it had the same channels as my current deal and the only difference was it had phone service. like i need that when i always have a phone with me.
2
i wish comcast would actually give af about this and make an effort to not be so shitty.  but they know this... and they be like "so"
2
good fuck comcast and their fraudulent business practices
2
i transferred my comcast service when i moved into a new house. 6 months later i got a notice in the mail from a debt collector. turns out comcast continued to charge me for service at the old address. emailing and calling comcast resulted in just hours wasted of my life. i finally resorted to just sending a legal letter to the debt company saying the bill is false and to never contact me again unless they want to settle it in court. fuck comcast with the fury of a thousand burning suns.

i dont have comcast (i intentionally made sure the place i live had alternatives), but i did and it was the worst isp experience of my life. they literally bullied their way into my market, pushed my existing isp out, took over as the provider, reduced my speeds by almost half, and increased the cost of my internet by 50%. then it kept going out and it could take days for them to address it. fun times. but that is not why i wanted to post. i wanted to post to say that it seems like even the people they hire exude the qualities and the behavior of the greater company they work for.  its almost like in order to be part of the concast cuntry club you need to be devoid of human decency and respect. yesterday is a good example, and one of many. i was taking my trash out and noticed that a comcast repair vehicle was setting in the middle of the road, in the alley just down from my house, and he was completely blocking the road. which is crappy because several of the people on my road use the alley to access their parking and garages. and he didnt even have to park there because he was working on a line at a house that had on-street parking directly in front of the property. he could have even just pulled to the side and most vehicles would have been able to get around. but oh fucking no, he is not doing his job if he is not being an asshole.sure enough, as i am looking at this, someone starts to pull in and gets blocked by the van. they back out and find another way in, which is a couple blocks up and couple blocks down and back, and then up the alleyway. as i finish emptying and sorting the trash, another car rolls up, turns in, and sets behind the comcast vehicle for a minute and finally gives a little honk. the comcast guy yells from the yard "find another way" and proceeds to ignore the car (which ended up doing the same as the other vehicle)considering that van was still setting there over an hour later when i left, and it is a busy alley, im sure this must have happened a dozen times or more during his stay (hell, i witnessed it twice in 2 minutes).the part that gets me is that he didnt have to do any of what he was doing, it was more like he wanted to, or just didnt give a crap about other people. especially when you consider that you never see the other isps behaving this way but you always see comcasts people doing it. perhaps that is why they are soulless and crooked: all the good people have been pushed out and the shitty people who are running things just hire more shitty people, creating one giant spinning shit wheel of douchebaggery, hatred and social destruction.

a few days ago, my comcast box was fried during thunderstorm, and so i had to get it replaced. my dad goes to pick up the replacement. he sets it up. this is a brand new box by the way. it does not work. he then spends two hours talking to comcasts support. they tell him everythings fine. turns out, that box was completely broken, and would not even partially work. they essentially tried to rip my family off. i ended up getting a new working box a couple of days later, but still, how can one be so incompetent to sell not just faulty, but completely broken equipment? blows my mind.
2
comcast literally has a deal with my apartment complex. we cant use any other internet. when i first signed up with them, they had unlimited internet. i work in vfx and sometimes work from home downloading massive amounts of data. a few months ago they turned our unlimited data into 1tb max. how much bs is that.... they are the worst company. lets never forget this.
2
remember the old lady that took a hammer to her local comcast office and got their attention. priceless
2
i dont even have comcast and i hate them.
2
bullshit. i live in an area with another cable company (atlantic broadband) that borders comcast (which i have personally).i went to a clients house 2 days ago to install a motorola modem/router on abb and i called them to provision it. lets go over how that went.1. spent an hour on hold getting to a tier 1 tech2. spent 30 minutes on the phone with this girl who said it was "online on her end" but it definitely was not (up/down lights were blinking simultaneously, access denied error in the web ui). she very abruptly transferred me to the tier 2 queue.3. 1.5 hours later in the tier 2 queue, i decided to give up. 3 hours was my limit with this bullshit. hooked the old d2 modem back up and it no longer worked, had the same 2 blinking lights.i have done the same on comcast, and i probably never had to stay on hold for more than 20 minutes, and the tier 1 tech always got it working. for those who think comcast is the worst, some of these smaller cable companies have worse customer support.
5
i need to knock on wood after this, but ill admit ive been having pretty good luck with comcast lately. my service has been steady, bills correct, and my phone calls have been pleasant.
4
does comcast really go out all the time for you people? i used to think mine was going out often, but there were a number of changes i made and havent had issues in a year. - their modems are crap. buy your own motorola surfboard and send back their modem. make sure they are no longer billing you for the modem rental. - remove or upgrade any splitters bringing you cable from the street. a tech can test if they are bad or too old. - stop using comcasts dns. i had the best success by switching to googles dns. if you do these things, i guarantee your comcast experience will improve.
2
im in sacramento and comcast is actually pretty decent here.  ive only had their service for 6 months, and the alternative is a very incompetent at&t service.
2
i suppose i might be one of the only people to have a positive experience with comcast. their customer service was great the 2 or 3 times i called, and my internet/cable never cuts out and is consistent in speed. the pricing seems okay compared to when i had fios with comparable internet speeds. fios was great too though, and verizons customer service was pretty good when i had it. rcn on the other hand...too many dead diablo 2 hardcore characters due to internet cutting in/out.
2
as it should be. my package, the "smallest available in my area" is 109 and yet my bill is upwards of 160 for very basic cable and decent internet. fuck comcast.
2
ive had no problems with comcast *per se*, but ill hate them for everyone elses problems.
1
i have  to restart my computer every so often or my internet speeds go from some 200 mb/s to 1-2 mb/s. i had lots of issues with fios, but nothing like what im having with comcast.
1
in my super small town we have verizon and comcast. verizon is super slow and unreliable, comcast is pretty reliable and fast but you pay for it. and not all people around here can afford the big city price of comcast.
1
im not from america so i dont know much about comcast except that there an isp, but why does everyone hate them?
1
where i live, i have the option of comcast or satellite. satellite service is like a fucking mortgage payment. so, comcast the only option without starving my children... for 2 yrs until they jack my rates to millionaire scale. then ill call and bitch at them until they extend it.
1
in the three major choices of tv and internet providers of at&t, comcast, or time warner:one is fast, one is reliable, and one is comcast.
1
ihave comcast and so far no issues other then small things that are annoying. can some one explain to me why comcast is so bad? maybe they are doing something i dont know about and would love the inside scoop.
1
it sort of begs the question as too why people still use comcast?comcast: "how may we help you?"sadist: "ooohhh, thats right daddy, hurt me more."comcast: "what?"sadist: "nothing."
1
seriously, fuck comcast.
1
whats funny is i was reading a white paper on brand loyalty, which i cant find atm.   anyway xfinity had a much higher nps score compared to comcast. like people dont know its the same company.
1
i despise comcast. despise...
1
this is no longer news.what will be news is when comcast is no longer rated the wcia.
1
nbc blocked comcast subscribers from streaming the golden globes online through their comcast account. comcast owns nbc. yeah. i hate them.
1
damn it comcast, that is supposed to be eas spot!
1
i hated comcast, until i moved somewhere where i had to get cox. i would kill for comcast now.
1
doesnt comcast own universal? do we all have to hate universal, too?
1
it may have to do with the fact they are probably the biggest provider too.  i just dropped at&t cuz, well 23mpbs down and 1.5mpbs up, for like 80/mo when im getting 90mbps down and 25mpbs up w/comcast for 59.but man their back-office is soo screwed up, i got tons of conflincting emails and whatnot.  i was constantly on alert to what they might be f-ing up.  and while the network is a lot faster, had my first outage the next morning.
1
comcast phone jockey had the audacity to tell me i was mistaken when i told them they were one of the most hated companies on the planet. fuck comcast.
1
lol not at all, i do however work in it and deal with the business side of comcast. the business side is still a completely different story, but wanted to give credit where credit is due.
1
i fucking hate comcast. i hope google comes through with a better internet option, this monopoly on cable and internet needs to fucking end.
1
sometimes i get frustrated with cox and then i remember what living in a comcast serviced area was like.
1
maybe im unusually tolerant, but i havent had a problem with comcast.  ive had one problem with my service when i first moved in and a technician actually came to my house and fixed it free of charge without me having to ever call in. he said they noticed the signal to my house was weak so he rewired everything in my house for free. the guy was really cool too. we played with my new drone after he was done. my bill has also never changed after having comcast for over 18 months like everyone always says it does.
1
i happen to like comcast
1
simple solution is to buy only their internet, get apple tv, and an antenna (might only work if you live near a big city). you should get cbs, abc, nbc, pbs, and fox. you might miss the cable a little, but you can keep that large chunk of change youre currently handing over to comcast.

had comcast is seattle. no real problems sure my rate would have sky rocketed after first year but i called to negotiate before that hit. first guy on the phone had poor english and kept telling me i had a great price i said no thanks send me to the cancellation person. she was a nice lady from the mid west whose husband liked hockey. she was able to get me a fair rate. leaving seattle dropped boxes off at store took pictures of returned item and return receipt never heard from them again.  now in rural ohio paying way to much for 1.5mb dsl i would welcome comcast/time warner with a bbq if they rolled down the road dropping in service.
1
so when does the invisible hand of capitalism bring comcast to its knees?
1
honestly, ive had comcast for 6+ years, moved 3 times, and never, ever had a problem with them. i get the hate and hear the stories, but theyve always been on time for me to install after moving, never fked around my billing, never had an outage...i dunno, never had a problem, ever.
1
only came here to say, "fuck comcast".carry on.
1
i live in east metro atlanta, ga, usa.  comcast is the only high speed internet provider on my street.  i lose internet connection about once every few minutes, lasting anywhere from 5 seconds to 120 seconds.  playing an online mmo is practically impossible sometimes. was anxiously awaiting google fiber, but just announced they were pulling out of the area. refuse to even attempt at&t dsl or directv satellite. so im stuck.
1
i understand why comcast is as hated as it is, but i really think at&t is far worse. i had them for cell and internet for a few years and finally cancelled when i moved to an area where they could provide neither. even though i was still in a "good coverage area" according to them, i never had any bars on my phone and would frequently have to drive into town just to make calls. my dsl would cut out all the time and id have to drive a few miles down the road just to call and tell them about it. they couldnt possibly have given less of a shit about either problem, and only offered to give me a few months of unlimited minutes for my troubles. i told them that wouldnt do me any good because i couldnt use them anyway, and apparently that was all they could do.the only thing that annoys me about comcast is that they call from time to time to try to get me to get a shitty cable package through them (i only have their internet).
1
comcast was my very first internet provider. i looked at my first bill and it was exactly double what they said it would be over the phone. mind you i already paid the one time set up fees and all that bs. so i used my months of internet and never paid the bill. they cancelled me and i explained why. they basically didnt care. 1 year later im getting calls from a collection agency. they sent my 150 bill to a collection agency. seriously what is the point of that! anyways i settled and only paid what i originally was supposed to pay for that months of service. not sure if that is a f u to comcast or i just need to get a life.
1
but havent your heard? comcast cares.
1
when my parents had comcast it would cut out every time it rained or had a slight breeze outside. they switched to verizon and have not had a single problem in the years since. then when i moved out, i also went with verizon and the only issue i had was easily solved with their mobile apps troubleshooting utility. cant complain.
1
i just moved so switched from twc to comcast.  jesus night and day difference in customer service.  honestly all my interactions with twc went well through 2 moves.
1
i hear that people have no choice but to have comcast? surely, and especially in a country as capitalist as the u.s., this goes against the very tenants of capitalism and a competitive market? you should never have 1 big monopoly. or am i missing something?
1
"but xfinity is looking good, right?" -some comcast board member, probably
1
someone knocked my door once and holy behold, it was a comcast employee trying to sell me his shitty service, i told him right away that i have at&t and am not looking to change service, and slammed the door...next thing you know he knocks....knocks.....and knocks...
1
at&t uverse is hot on their heels.  recently moved and took chance to ditch comcast.  a month later and down service for 1/4 of the time i actually called comcast back.  and they dont service my area.
1
i left comcast over a month ago and theyre still trying to fuck me over a lousy 40 that *they* owe *me.*
1
this pleases me. fuck comcast.
1
about 6 months ago i moved into a new apartment and had to purchase comcast (former verizon customer, but no coverage in my neighborhood).i went on their website and found a seemingly fair priced bundle. 45/mo for internet, basic cable, and hbo. perfect package for me.what i did next was call comcast, confirm the offer was still valid, and *asked them what other fees would be involved*. they outlined the modem rental fee, one time service activation fee, my citys 5 broadcast fee, optional installation fee (i opted to install myself), and taxes. now that i had a better idea, i signed up, and drove to the nearest service center to pick up my installation kit.waited in line at the service center for 5 minutes. gave them my name and drivers license. was handed a nice bag with remote, modems, and self installation kit. went home, followed the instructions (which were literally outlines of which cords to plug in, a 4th grader could do it). bam! cable and internet were working fine. but oh wait, hbo was not working for some reason. i called comcast, explained that my hbo was not working, they told me to sit tight for one minute and reset my cable box. moments later, hbo was working.this entire process took a total of 2 hours. most of which was spent driving to the service center for my installation kit. i was also very high that afternoon so it probably could have taken less time. overall, i cannot complain about the company.
1
how are they still in business? why arent customers abandoning comcast?
1
ok, so lets think about this for a moment. if you want more bandwidth after your initial allotment, its 10 per 50gb. but if you want to receive less bandwidth and pay less money, comcast subtracts 5 for **295 gb**.is this some sort of joke?their whole justification for this (at least what they tell the public), is that people who use a lot of bandwidth should pay more, and people who use less should pay less. so the best they can do for people who use only 5gb per month, is 5 less, and for people who use more, its 10 per 50gb? my fucking god. just when i thought comcast couldnt be any more of a scumbag, they go and outdo themselves with flying colors.

ive had to use comcast for more than 10 years now. its interesting, to follow the history of this development. way back in 2003-2007ish, they did not have any official limits. in fact, their service had been sold under the marketing term "unlimited internet"what they started doing around then, was forwarding people who they said downloaded the top 1% of the data to their abuse department. those people would get a threatening call from comcast abuse that would tell them to cut back on their download or have their service disconnected for abuse. these calls were intentionally vague about how much you were supposed to cut back, and they would use terms such as "youve downloaded the equivalent of 90 movies, or x number of photos" where x was some number that i cant remember.these werent just threats. one person created a blog (its still up at comcastissue.blogspot.com - but if you go there start reading from the beginning) in 2007 to discuss how he had his internet cut off for a year. his story is outrageous. they called his wife with the threatening call, but she didnt believe it was really comcast (rightfully so! it sounded like a prank call considering he had been sold "unlimited" service), so he called them back and because the company was so disorganized, they denied it was them in the first place. they assured him his internet really was unlimited as advertised... however one month later he had his internet disconnected by this same abuse department. he was banned from comcast broadband internet for a long while because of it.i might be slightly mistaken, because im working from what i remember from several years ago, and i dont have sources handy to back this up. but eventually a class action lawsuit got them over this (i think it was in florida). it was revealed that they were constantly threatening the top 1% of their users with vague phone calls and sometimes disconnected them. of course if the top 1% were to cut back their usage to an unknown but adequate amount to avoid being banned from the internet, there would be a new 1% to receive threats in the next month.in any case, the class action lawsuit forced comcast to stop this bullying of customers, at least not without spelling out the requirements for all customers. hence they started rolling out these 300gb bandwidth limits on everyone, and making the limits known. the trouble is that the internet is rapidly growing -- for a small suburban family that has netflix, and several family members using it, this simply is not enough for some people. they are making huge profits and could easily work on upgrading their network, however instead they want to punish people who are ahead of the tech curve.another thing that irks me about this limit is youll notice they are selectively choosing areas where they are the monopoly (or alternatives are much worse) to enforce it. if you live, say in the silicon valley area in ca, where there are lots of tech people with multiple options for internet -- you wont get a limit. if youre in suburban tennessee, well you better not get ahead on the tech curve. seriously, just notice the areas and cities they are mentioning. i suspect they know exactly what they are doing here. if they enforced a limit in certain areas, there would be major fallout from the competition who could do something about it, and they know it. dsl might be available as a crap substitute in some of those areas, but in general these are areas where customers have no choice but to obide by the decrees of comcast.another issue is that is you read the wording on this page, they talk like its a 10 dollar fee to use additional bandwidth when really, its a fine. so, the deal is, if you go over by 1gb, so say you use 301gb, you get a 10 fee. the reason its really a fine, is because that extra 49gb does not transfer over to the next month, nor do you get refunded for any of it if it isnt used in the same 30 day period. if they were really selling you an additional 50gb block as stated on that page, then you should be able to use the remainder of it next month. instead if you use 301gb in the next month, you get a 10 fine again. this may be me being nitpicky, but ive found quite a few people complaining over this in their own support forum. the wording on this page is really deceptive.the tldr; comcast has a horrid history of doing evil things to people for going over what was once an unknown bandwidth limit, including banning them from the internet and leaving them without options. after being slapped on the wrist with a lawsuit, they now state a limit but they are selectively choosing cities and areas where users cant do anything about it, thus punishing people who are technologically ahead. this is despite making record profits and being able to afford to upgrade their network to support progress.

fuck it.  at least we dont have to use comcast.  ill gladly give my money to . . . shit.

i live in woodstock, georgia: one of the guinea pig areas where theyre testing this structure out. to put it into perspective, i share an apartment with my best friend, so its just two college kids. we only use netflix because we cant afford cable, and we hit our data cap about 13 days before the end of each billing cycle. this is just for netflix, reddit, and schoolwork. we dont do any online gaming, skype, youtube, or music streaming. its a complete shit show and i cant imagine this working for a family if 4. fuck comcast, and fuck their monopoly that they have on my city.edit: i seem to have upset some people by implying that gaming online uses a significant amount of data. thats not what i was saying, i was just illustrating that the extent of our data usage is almost exclusively netflix, reddit, and schoolwork.  sorry for the confusion.edit 2: i have taken suggestions and bumped my netflix quality to standard. hopefully thatll help.ed edd & edit 3: im learning about so many woodstocks that arent in georgia.

i think all current customers of comcast start making calls and complain to them about this policy even if theyre not being affected by it at the moment.theyre doing this to others and soon no one will be safe from it.
1037
10 for 50 gb eh?   i can buy a 50 gb blu ray disk and ship it across the country for less than that. verbatim and fedex can produce a blu ray disk, get it to me, and then put in on trucks and planes and move it across the country for less than comcast can move bits across a wire?? interesting.      this is sorta like the water company charging bottled water prices for tap water.
719
my family used 750 gigs last month and 990 the month prior to that.if comcast puts these charges into place i will be switching internet providers immediately. simply cant afford their services anymore.

google fiber can kill ten people right now and id still sign up for it over comcastedit: thank you kind stranger for the gold!
4710
mediacom caps my home usage to 250gb/mo. with pretty exorbitant overage fees. theyre just as shitty as comcast just less widely used/known.
200
fuck comcast. im finally able to drop them this week. so sick of their shitty, overpriced "service."
135
this is exactly what weve been fighting against all these weeks. because tom wheeler is content sitting on his ass collecting lobbying dollars comcast knows they can get away with it now.
104
i currently have 300mbps down, 20mbps up, and no monthly data cap for 65 a month on time warner cable. between myself and my room mates, we use well over 1tb of bandwidth almost every month.if time warner is successfully bought out by comcast, i will fucking kill myself. time warner isnt great but comcast is far worse.
95
fuck comcast.
428
i dont have comcast but cant help but constantly read about their tactics and i now i even hate comcast.
37
this is not new. i have been dealing with this shit for a year now. i have to constantly watch my meter to make sure i dont go over and pay a fine.i hate comcast so much, but my only other option is att and they have a 250gb limit. the atlanta market is really bad.help us google fiber, youre our only hope.
112
hey, comcast. fuck you.
107
its amazing how comcast continues to find new and inovative ways to piss people off!
75
if isps are reclassified as utilities, i can see this becoming the norm unless they are specifically forced not to. other utilities are metered like power and water so wouldnt being classified as a utility give comcast the excuse to start charging for metered usage.edit: have you people never seen where the internet comes from. hard working people mine gigabytes from the ground and someday were going to run out. do your part to save resources.  /s

i know this comment is a drop of piss in a latrine, but i want ops post to be the top post for days.  i want to see 10k+ upvotes and 10s of thousands of comments.  if youre reading this, fuck my comment, please upvote the thread, and all those top gilded comments.and fuck you comcast, seriously.  i mean that will all my heart.  and also fuck how futile talking about it is.  for as good and fun as reddit is, all reddit does is get people to complain together and circlejerk... which is just enough of a release to prevent people from burning them to the ground.currently there are 5,734 upvotes.  imagine if 5,734 people showed up and started tearing their hq apart.  i might actually cry that sounds so beautiful.
28
anyone else think comcast is just taunting us at this point? like "check it out, we can make ourselves look worse and worse and still make money from our uninformed customers, lol"
12
i bet that this reddit thread is getting forwarded around comcast offices, and the employees are reading all your replies with sarcastic or girly voices and everyone is laughing.
9
so, are we going to get to the point where comcast is anally raping us with ethernet cables before someone shuts them down?
28
comcast showing once again why they are whats wrong with service providers
16
non-american here, i was wondering why the american people have not launched a full scale revolution against comcast? how is this company allowed to run? i get that its a massive corporation but i hardly see anything done about this useless company by the people. is it because they are actually powerless? i would love someone to give me an honest answer.
32
comcast - a haiku------fuck you fuck you fuckyou fuck you fuck you fuck youfuck you fuck pay me
13
lets do some math here for a 50 mb connection:300 gb can be downloaded in about 13 hours at maximum bandwidth.there are about 730 hours in a month.that means users are allowed to use make full use of the internet for a mind blowing 1.8 % of a months time (one point eight percent!!!). go fuck yourself comcast.
6
comcast executive: people hate us.other comcast executive: not enough.
8
how does comcast still have customers!!!!  at some point, you have to conclude that no internet (or only cellphone internet) is better than buying from comcast!
4
contrary to basically every comment on here, this makes very happy. the reason this makes me happy is that it is such a stupid move on comcasts part that this might actually destroy the company entirely. i am all for comcast committing suicide.
5
holy fucking balls. i know this will never be seen but i need to vent off. what the fuck is happening with comcast. how the fuck does the united states of fucking america not do anything to protect their citizen from these horrible noncaring companies? shit. and here im sitting with my 10 eur/month unlimited fiber. http://www.speedtest.net/result/3925556607.png
7
i live in ga. they started this on us back in january. i dont even remember a time when i just paid a flat fee for the internet.when they started they gave us 3 "courtesy" credits for the first 3 times we went over our 300gb allotment in the month. needless to say i used those up the first three months.my plan cost 70 for 50mb, i now pay an average of about 140. one month it was 280.my biggest issue is there are no other options, if they want more money because theyre dicks then fine, but give me a choice to pay more for a larger plan that i can actually stay in. its also incredibly annoying at how bad they are at billing for it, there was one month they accidentally issued a credit to my bill for the amount owed due to overage. i thought maybe they were just being nice or revoking the data plan altogether, but instead they just added the amount i was supposed to pay to the next month.there are 0 other options for hi-speed internet in my area so im just stuck with it. i found out google fiber was coming to my area a few months ago and nearly started crying when i realized they were deploying in 3-4 cities around me but not my own. this is my life, ive seen the future. **run.**tl;dr i live in a city where comcast charges me extra for usage, it blows
6
if google fiber was started by hitler himself i would still choose that over comcast.
6
in atlanta where they are trying this out. was never explained to me until i got hit with a 300 bill. why? went over on data. didnt even know it was possible because it was never explained. and also, apparently blew threw all of my "freebies" because hey, no one bothered to tell me. refused to pay and planned to switch...cant because my brand new apartment complex in downtown atlanta is "only wired for comcast". so yea. now i have no internet in my apartment because fuck it. you gotta draw the line somewhere. hold my dick comcast
7
guess its time to sign up for the comcast business line because 300gb is shit when you stream movies a couple times a week + downloads. i dont see chicago on there but last month we crossed 2.3tb alone.clarification: much of that is streaming ads all day for monetization.
14
yet another example of why comcast is the worst company in the united states.
11
i knew it was a matter of time before comcast/verizon/cox/centurylink/charter/at&t started doing this.i just wondered which one of them would be ballsy enough to do it first.
5
cant wait for comcast to bring back that 400 free minute cds.
6
comcast is pulling this shit before the twc merger is approved? that takes some balls!
4
my local isp may be expensive as fuck, but at least they arent comcast.
6
look, i consciously *try* (disclaimer:  im not perfect) to stay away from circlejerk/hivemind stuff on reddit as much as i can.  i find that most of the time, its straight-up egregious.  however, even i have to join in the anti-comcast circlejerk on this one.  this is the most ridiculous horse shit ive ever heard of.  comcast is the most profitable cable company in the world, and yet, they keep finding ways to jack their prices up as if theyre fucking going out of business.  honestly, fuck comcast.
5
http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/leadership-overviewso these are the faces my fists want to punch..
3
everyone saying fuck comcast obviously doesnt see that this will be the result of reclassifying internet as a utility.  metered usage. seems like the anti-comcast circlejerk is too strong to see this is the result of the net neutrality proposal obama mentioned last week.
3
fuck off comcast you are a disease. just leave us consumers alone!sincerely,every comcast customer
3
start complaining to netflix and amazon and other streaming companies by telling them that youll no longer be able to afford to rent movies or download anything from them anymore. use the other large corporations to go after cable companies like comcast and make them fight for us.we cant win, but maybe they can win this fight for us.

im happy that comcast isnt available in my area

why is it that comcast can pull this shit but verizon legally has to keep me grandfathered into unlimited data? how are the service contracts different here?
3
if only it were legal for me to offer competing service. if i started hanging fiber lines on poles do you know how quickly i would be in jail? it shouldnt be this way. we should allow competition. i want 50 isps at my house. forget antitrust laws or trying to dictate how comcast does business. we just need options and the ability to leave. if customers were leaving then they wouldnt be able to screw them without shooting themselves in the foot.sadly this move by comcast will bring all the liberal idiots to the floor. they will protest for more regulations that will actually end up benefiting comcast. we need to get rid of regulations that are present, not create new regulations that comcast can throw money at to change in their favor.
4
comcast is the funniest corporation in the u.s. their entire business model is seeing how hard they can fuck their customers and boy do their customers just love their dicks in their asses.
4
so why is netflix paying comcast for bandwidth usage if the consumer is getting gouged, too?
4
i would do almost anything to make comcast extinct.

americans, your problem is outside of the fccs hands. obama appointed a chairman who can best be described as a corporate shill acting on the interests of these cable and telecommunications companies so hell-bent on fucking you over.if you truly care about your internet, stop bitching about it on the internet, regurgitating scumbag comcast and scumbag tom wheeler memes, and signing e-petitions that wont do shit and **take more drastic action.**[the people of hungary - a former warsaw pact nation - have put you all to shame by recently staging large-scale protests](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29846285) to fight back against a repressive internet data tax which would have otherwise been imposed upon them by their government. and the rates the hungarian government were going to charge are 60% of what comcast intend to charge through xfinity internet economy plus.in fact, the kind of crap comcast, at&t, time warner cable, and verizon have either imposed or are trying to impose should have the country up in arms and rioting. yet no riots have occurred. all it took for hungarians to rise up in arms were plans for an internet data tax which is 40% lower than the data tariffs on comcasts xfinity internet economy plus. how does it feel to be outclassed by your former political enemies?
6
there are 300 million people in the united states and comcast market cap is 150 billion. if we all chip in 365 dollars we can buy a controlling share in comcast and run it as a non-profit.
3
i really hate comcast right now.
8
this is totally understandable. we all know data is a nonrenewable resource.  if it werent for concerned companies like comcast doing this, 10-20 years from now we may be faced with a global data shortage. think of our childrens generation, people. data rationing is the only option to ensure a healthy internet for them. god bless comcast.
13
this would destory online gaming. i pray this isnt an industry standard soon. though if google fiber is spreading at a decent rate wouldnt comcast be looking to try and keep people on board?
6
i really think these sort of changes are just swan songs. i know it seems silly, but in a few years, i see comcast going under.
3
comcast customer service reps, i hope you are considering a different job. i can only imagine the shit they will get from management for not upselling this shitty promotion and the shit they will have to deal with when customers call to discuss their bill.
3
serious question, how is rcn if anybody has it? im going to be canceling my subscription to comcast tonight.
3
according to comcast, the average customer is using 20-25 gb per month...which is bullshit.  two people live in my house, and netflix is probably our biggest data use.  were not torrenting tons of shit.  we spend time on reddit etc, and watch netflix.  and our average is 250-300 gb per month.  this whole thing is bullshit.
3
good guy comcast. pushing the america people to the breaking point to highlight pervasive corporate corruption in the government. theyre like a modern day caligula.theyre literally fucking with the bread and circuses.
3
so if anyone feels like ending it all and going on a homicidal rampage soon, any comcast execs would make nice targets. just sayin
3
seems like i have to research areas where comcast exists before i buy a home nowadays.
3
comcast has been doing this for years already.  when i lived in pa more than 3 years ago, i had a cap on my monthly usage.  this doesnt excuse some of the more underhanded things they are trying to do with this, im just saying its not new news.
3
can we have a fk off comcast day here on reddit?   well all call in and set up fake orders and tech support problems..everyone calling and starting hassles will cost them a bunch..lets just keep it up for days.
3
honestly people, you want this to stop? you need to take action instead of just bitching at it on reddit/twitter/facebook/wherever. protest outside of comcast regional/nationwide hq. draw attention to the issue and make your voices heard. these headlines are in the news constantly and what does everyone do? posts online, where comcast just ignores it. when you complain about it online all you are doing is preaching to the choir.take action, get mad, and show them in person how pissed off you are.
3
i see this as an attack on netflix. comcast was trying to find a way to get netflix to shut their mouths about net neutrality, and this is their punishment. if you have to pay for all that data, netflix becomes unaffordable for a lot of users.
3
im from denmark so what comcast do, dont really affect me. but it is still interesting to me how the us, while no doubt being a great country and world leader on some fronts, can be so backwards and like a third world country on others. it actually makes me kinda angry on your behalf! i have 100mbit/100mbit fiber costing me around 45/month with no limits. i actually dont know of any isp in denmark using limits for home internet connections. i can also use netflix all i want in hd with no throttling ever. hell, even my mobile phone plan allow me to speak unlimited while having a data cap at 10gb at 20/month. it amazes me that the us government allow this poor service for your country without interfering. i sincerely hope things will change for you guys, because you are getting straight up robbed and i feel for you. :/internet and healthcare in the us are two areas where i really dont envy you. we also have 100% free healthcare here in denmark.
3
why hasnt *anonymous* or any other similar group hacked into comcast and effed their day up? they did it to multiple companies a few years ago with relative ease from the way it looked. and comcast probably deserves it more than any of them.or is there something i am totally missing and im just an idiot?
3
i am in nashville and was one of the first to in their trial. i dropped them as soon as i got constant popups stating that i was over my data usage for the month. i have kids who watch netflix and play steam games. we use close to 600 gigs a month and my bill would have went from 175 to 240 at that usage. i went with tds and have 100mbps internet and my bill dropped to 140 a month with unlimited data. i am just glad that i had a choice because comcast sucks.
3
fuck comcast.
3
i went from comcast to cox and my god i tell you what my heart nearly exploded when i saw [this](http://www.speedtest.net/result/3925541153.png)
3
comcast is fucking us right in the ass.
3
i dont have comcast and i am so angry at this.
3
i have time warner.comcast wants to merge with time warner.im fucking terrified.what are my options?
3
why are people still using comcast?!?! i dont care if theyre the only game in town. if everyone collectively stopped using those greedy fucks theyd be forced to earn the business they lost. do not reward shite corporations by buying their products and services.
3
correct me if im wrong; but as an outsider from europe with no connections and a lack of general interest in the usa - it seems to me comcast appear to be the largest joke for a company ive heard of in the internet/tv business.it feels like its every month something of this nature creeps up; comcast got me sacked, return fees...stupid sales...non-existent customer service.is there anything comcast does well or am i right in making this assumption?
3
is it unhealthy if i have this fantasy that the presidents of comcast, att, sprint, verizon, tom wheeler are all taken out one by one? because i do. movie style.
3
well, they did it.i just canceled my comcast.in the next couple days while i wait for condo internet(seattle) ill simply be using my phone.
3
this new just annoys me to no end. comcast thinks their customers are stupid. thats all this says to me.
3
i would unsubscribe from those money eating dirt bags quicker than i close out my porn tabs after a fap session. fuck comcast.
3
as a resident of georgia this  sucks and has been happening for a year already. i dont watch cable tv so netflix and amazon are my visual feeds. i consistently go over the 300gb cap and have to pay more on my bill. its ridiculous but sadly i have no other choice. not sure when google fiber will be up and running in atlanta but when it does comcast is going to feel looser than a rectum after taco bells mega taco box. fuck comcast.
3
ill probably be crucified, but at least they are advertising this and letting people know what they are paying for.  sure, they are scumbags, but it isnt because of this.everyone who is tempted to post "comcast is screwing us over" should stop, count to 3, and then say "my local government is screwing me over by continuing to allow comcast a monopoly in my area".
3
id rather have no internet. back to stealing and bootlegging out the trunk peeps. god forbid you stream netflix, play xbox live, or download steam games and shit; comcast will rape your ass with overage and convenience fees until youre left sore and defeated!
3
legitimate question: how can we the people start a movement calling for the break up of comcast? these guys are almost as bad as ma bell, if not worse.
3
time to organize locally and push to build a public utility in individual cities to do what comcast does.   we need to put comcast out of business by competing against them.
3
how i read the article- "comcast announces the company secretly works for the nazi regime after a previous accusation that satan was there ceo- which is also true."
3
i live in atlanta and have been under this plan for a while. its insanely frustrating coming from an unlimited plan to one that is limited. download a couple steam games this month? better watch that meter or youll get overage fees. watch movies or streams frequently? better not use hd or youll get overage fees. i have to watch my meter each month and skirt it. ive actually avoided watching some movies or downloading large files because it would put me close to the cap. im literally rationing bandwidth, which is **not** something that needs to happen in this day and age.you know whats the worst part? theres no way to get a higher tier. none. no matter your internet speed youre capped at the same amount. how does that make sense at all? its a blatantly obvious play to squeeze more money out of everyone because there is **literally no way** to pay for more bandwidth aside from just plunging in to overage fees when you hit the standard cap. they are forcing you to hit their insanely high costing overage fees if you want more than that. ridiculous.this is why comcast is one of the most despised companies. nothing they do makes sense and just enrages everyone. i really wait for the day when they actually have competition and cant get away with stuff like this.
3
aaa video game makers and online video game distribution like valve need to be totally against this. this is terrible for their business. this turns a 60 game you bought and download into a 120 purchase. it would be as if video game prices went up 100%.you do not raise prices that dramatically. horrible, horrible. if i were in philly at comcast hq, i would spend a lot of free time picketting.
3
data caps are a scam. especially since data is not a finite resource.although youre (hypothetically) paying for an up to** 25mb/s down 5mb/s up internet connection, the reality with a 300 gb data cap is that if you were to utilize your internet at 100% for the entire month, you would only be able to transfer data at a rate of 0.913mb/s or 913.242kb/s.although youre (hypothetically) paying for an up to** 25mb/s down 5mb/s up internet connection, the reality with a 300 gb data cap is that if you were to utilize your internet at 100% for the entire month, you would only be able to transfer data at a rate of 0.913mb/s or 913.242kb/s.heres a break down of what using 300gb per month looks like in terms of speed given that there is 2628000 seconds in 1 month and 2400 gb in 300 gb: * 300gb / 1 month* 2400gb / 1 month* 78.904gb / 1 day* 3.288gb / 1 hour* 54.795mb / 1 minute* **913.242kb / 1 second (0.913mb/s)**comcast and other isp could brand this as "bandwidth control" but, when, in reality, youre paying for 0.913mb/s a month, this really looks as if they are trying increasing their revenue while also trying to keeping the old cable model alive.edit: for clarification.
3
this makes me even more pissed of that i will now have to refer to the nascar nationwide series as the xfinity series. fuck comcast.
3
> receive a 5.00 credit on their monthly bill and reduce their data usage plan from 300 gb to 5 gb.what the fuck?> have 5 dollars back a month, but youre only allowed to stream 3 movies from netflix, otherwise well charge you a dollar for each additional movie you watchfuck you, comcast.
3
at this point i have started rooting for comcast. how far can they go? how deep in the ass can they fuck a costumer? this is pinnacle of monopoly, corrupt politicians, non-existent regulations and money, money, money. i am making some popcorn this is insane.
3
when this is forced on me, and on the wider population as a whole, it might have some interesting consequences. for one, i will either enroll in their plan and micromanage the hell out of it to stay in bounds or ill simply have to stop using comcast and the internet as a whole. this means that overall, internet traffic in the us will be reduced considerably.thats significant for a lot of reasons.at work, i use the internet. at school, i use the internet. for fun, i use the internet. if i have to keep my internet usage as low as possible, im not going to buy content that i will also have to download, and then pay comcast extra. this is especially true if comcast decides to further sour things by increasing the costs/restrictions further when the plan goes national. this means going to facebook much less frequently, shopping online much less frequently -- and, in general, *avoiding using any service that is internet-based* in order to give myself room for important things.im really curious when things will give out, how things will give out, and what the fallout will be. things will certainly get a lot worse before they get better, though. bribery is effectively legal, which means comcast and the us government will generally ignore the effects of the monopoly indefinitely. not to mention there are a lot of people who will just tolerate comcasts ever-slimier business practices, or just cant get enough stupid cable tv and just dont care what the cost is.will the internet situation get so bad that google abandons fiber and begin to move their operations to a country with a functioning internet? could comcasts exponentially greedy internet service "plans" begin damaging the us economy in any way?
3
so since everyone already knows how bad comcast is, what can we actually do about it?
3
i live in england, and i really feel for you americans; comcast sound like a loathsome company full of greedy bastards.
3
and if the public swallows it. theyll implement "free-lanes" where companies can pay them to not have the traffic count against customers caps. fuck comcast, fuck isps in general and fuck our govenrment for serving the interests of a wealthy few instead of the public at large.
3
i have a plan. we all apply for jobs to comcast and run it out of business.
3
fuck comcast. fuck comcast. fuck comcast. fuck comcast.
3
lol. to begin? you guys are lateeeeeeeeee. in atlanta this has been going on for a while. comcast gives you a 300gb and att a 250.
6
comcast i would tell you to suck my dick, but i dont have the money to pay the dick sucking fee youll charge me!
5
i love how people believe in free capitalism but still bitch about comcast screwing everyone. dont use comcast? no alternative?  that cant be the case because free markets hurrrdurr
4
as an unfortunate comcast customer in nashville, does this affect my current plan?
2
comcast does not give a fuck!
2
well. im going to go buy stock in comcast.
2
next from comcast:  the rape your grandmother plan!
2
comcast wants no competition for being the worst company ever.
2
no, seriously, fuck you comcast.
2
i would move before having to deal with this shit, really i would move and spend the money to relocate a few blocks down the road where i could get fios than deal with these assholes. fuck comcast.and if i had no other choice i would really move back to nl or at and never have to deal with shit like this ever again. getting tired of these monopoly type corporations and the corrupt lobbied to the core government shitbags that run this country.
2
the only way to get them to stop is to drop comcast en masse. they have no reason to stop fucking the customer of they are still making money.
2
fuck this a million times, comcast is a bane on this society. when will this madness end?
2
i live in one of the trial areas. they sent us an email saying they changed to this model months back and we have gone over our 300gb for 3 months. those 3 months will be free but the next time they will start charging us. after multiple conversations with various comcast reps, we havent been charged yet. i told them this was bullshit and this wasnt the plan we sign up for. from everything ive read about comcast, it seems like they dont give a flying fuck and will just start charging me whenever and whatever the fuck they feel like.
2
comcast continues to show its ignorance all while the net neutrality policies are being decided.  if there is a god wheeler will see this and decide to fist fuck them back for the consumers.  he is pushing for some good measures for consumers, hopefully this can be a final straw in the nn debate.
2
heres hoping that google will aggressively work against these plans. capped internet is a major problem for services like youtube.all along, ive held the belief that google fiber is not meant to provide internet services. instead, its meant to be a weapon against dirty isps that aim to harm googles main source of income. if an isp starts acting up, all google has to do is announce fiber expansion to a number of their territories to force them back in line. im really hoping they bully comcast back into line.its such a shame that our best hope is google instead of our regulatory committees.
2
if i lived in a place where comcast was my only option for internet, id move. im not even kidding.
2
this is possibly the best way to get people away from comcast. all people are going to do is shy away
2
this is a terrible idea. if i wanted to pay for internet in data chunks i would cancel my comcast subscription and use the 4g hotspot on my phone, its faster than my home wifi anyways!but as of now im stuck with comcast because its actually packaged into my apartments lease agreement. if i dont pay for comcast internet i have to find a new place to live (which im trying to do).
2
gotta love that in our capitalist society we get exactly one choice for cable internet.why cant there be a reasonable alternative to comcast in my area.
2
what did you expect? comcast to make a good decision?
2
i think this link should be paired with the recent article on comcasts paid washington lobbyists.cant find the original article, but here is one on the 76 washington lobbyists working the time warner merger:http://time.com/79569/comcast-has-about-76-lobbyists-working-washington-on-cable-merger-this-is-why/in addition to the recent hiring of an aid to the chairman of the senate commerce committee:http://articles.philly.com/2014-10-26/business/55425604_1_comcast-corp-john-bergmayer-former-fcc-commissionerswitching to a data cap policy would probably require a massive increase in the number of lobbyists on this issue alone, if it hasnt already.
2
a sensible solution would be to break comcast the isp and comcast the cable company into two separate companies. not sure how much would actually change, but it should probably be done. also sucks that they own nbc and all their properties, that should have never happened.
2020
comcast should be broken up forcefully. i do **not** normally support this kind of intervention, but under extreme circumstances it is appropriate. comcast uses its size to price gouge consumers. they are often the only option for internet in some areas. competition is non existent. they are effectively a monopoly. they behave like one too. edit: just realized i said the same thing as top comment.... -.- i always post stuff and realize its already been said. im totally not a drone that is thinking exactly the same thing as everyone else give a same set of inputs. [i totally have free will.....](http://absolutetruth.in/article/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/freewill.jpeg)
237
not that i disagree with the sentiment, but hulu and comcast are siblings.
340
i think this might be the bad thing that ends up having good come out of it. for too long only the super data users cared about stuff like this. but this is going to gradually cause more and more people to become upset and i see it causing a rise in municipal fiber networks in the next ten years. it sucks for comcast users now but the more hate they get the greater the demand for municipal fiber i think.
224
games are pushing 20-40 gigs now.  not including bandwidth for online games.  that means if i download a game, i lose roughly 40 hours of shit streaming and roughly 10 hours of normal "hd" streaming.comcast is shit.  i havent subscribed to them for years.
30
comcast owns hulu. iirc
58
this is really going to make hacking wifi networks a lot more popular in comcast areas. the city im in has a couple isps, each one controlling their own neighborhoods. im in the comcast neighborhood, but im only a little ways from a different isp... perhaps i can move, and then to pay my extra rent, ill charge people to load their hdds with the movies they cant watch using comcast?
33
yeah, taxpayers already paid 400 billion dollars to upgrade the infrastructure to broadband. this is the kind of respect we get. comcast needs to know its place.(http://newnetworks.com/shortscandalsummary.htm)
23
from comcast standpoint it makes perfect sense. they literally own the only source of meaningful internet for most areas and can basically make any price they want with no repercussions. if you really care about this issue contact the fcc and file a complaint, contact your local representative, **and vote**. if your demographic group is shown to be politically inactive there is zero incentive for a politician to help you.
15
as im a contractor for these type of companies. i can say that the technology is here the problem is those who run it. cord cutting will never demise the big cable giants in the us or in the world for that matter. problem is every telecom provider in the us all lease the same fiber on the back haul. twc, charter, sudden link, comcast, etc. all use level 3 as their main fiber connection, reason they arent a telecom or isp for residential as well as commercial is due to laws based around monopolies. now if the companies did a overhaul and reevaluate what they could do then they could do a reprieve of their image and actually gain customers back
43
fuck comcast
6
how great would it be to see comcast become one of those corporation giants that no longer exists by 2020?
4
doesnt comcast _own_ hulu? so they arent losing _anyone_ to that. conversely, they might be _gaining_ subs to hulu thanks to their new ad-free(ish) option.
3
i have satellite internet, i wish i could get comcast. after paying 3x the amount that most people pay for internet i get 15 gigs a month.
3
the simple fact is that if comcast provided better service, more options, and did it at a reasonable price, people would not have a reason to leave.  instead of giving people reasons to stay, comcast gives them reasons to leave, especially in areas where the company does not perceive competition.  comcast has not figured out, yet, that their artificial monopoly in most areas will not last, and the more they give people reasons to leave now the quicker those people will leave when the opportunity presents itself.  for some reason, the company refuses to evolve, and it has a lot to do with next quarter profits.  shareholders should be scared for the future of comcast.
3
im sorry to anyone who has comcast as the only option. to anyone that willingly picked comcast, shame on you.
3
i hate to say this but because of this, comcasts cable service (xfinity i think?) should shut down permanently, as well as the rest of the company. its amazing how svod could replace cable. i mean, everyone hates comcast and twc right?
3
i think watching comcast is like watching a titan thrashing about trying vainly to retain its monopoly on power. eventually we will all see the futility of the thrashing. there will always be tyrants but the people ultimately rule.. sometimes change takes a long time and a lot of pain.
3
im in one of the cities where this is being done and this is going to be the thing that finally gets me to switch from comcast to my municipal isp.
6
comcast owns 1/3 of hulu so at the very least theyre doing some double dipping here.
4
cant we form some kind of reddit lobby and start making it clear to the political authority that if they dont start proactively doing something about a despised and reviled company with predatory practices and bald-face monopolies such as comcast, then we will in turn proactively replace them with representatives who will??just a thought.
3
a simple solution is for netflix to call their bluff.  just ban comcast users from using netflix.  either the customers will leave or demand comcast to cave in from gouging them.
4
lol, americans and your shitty isps that you have wasted your tax dollars on. i dont know why you guys hate to get value for your tax dollars with healthcare and education. but spending billions on giving comcast free infrastructure that only comcast is allowed to use can be done without much discussion because everyone you vote for thinks its a great idea. americans are crazy
20
this honestly helps me understand why they are pissed off (but i still think they are assholes). what could comcast do to compete? i have comcast internet and use hulu, hbogo, netflix, and amazon prime. never really considered getting cable.edit: stupid phone
2
comcast owns hulu
2
wouldnt it be fun if you bought a game on steam towards the end of your month, and you had to pay comcast more to finish the download!  gta 5 was 60gb+ i thought.theres a whole lotta reasons this is bullshit aside the obvious attack on netflix, hulu, amazon, and other worthwhile media services.
2
next up on comcasts agenda: setting 10,000 tcp or udp connections per day limit, 0.10/connection afterward.
2
this is the problem with monopolies like comcast.  im generally a pretty pro-free market guy but this situation may call for government intervention.
2
eventually most of the cable companies will gradually shy away further and further from the actual cable and move toward the internet sales point. alot of companies are making the move to fiber/ gbit internet. i work for a phone company and we are selling gbit internet, ip phone service an tv over ethernet. companies like comcast will adapt or go bankrupt, not that they will be missed.
2
soon the people who dont check their comcast email will be getting hit with the overages because they didnt know about the cap. hell, i didnt even notice i was affected until i saw it on reddit.
2
buy as much offline storage as possible and download as much as possible onto them. use plex to stream to chromecast and never look back to netflix or hulu again. this is what comcast is encouraging, so those without data caps should fire up their vpn and download everything.
2
i dont understand how the govt can go after msft and goog for anti competitive practices yet comcast can pull all of this shit with no repercussions.
1
isnt hulu owned by comcast?
1
can we start a kick starter to buy comcast?  their net worth is only around 1 billion it shouldnt be that hard.
1
get satellite and, if you want to fight latency, some small link. just stop payments my comcast
1
its like comcast knows its fucked, so the only solution they have is to milk all the money they can before they tank.
1
just so everyone keeps it in mind; hulu is comcast.
1
well, it *will* work, in areas that have only comcast as an option.
1
fack comcast .
1
i used to think big cable companies could never lose their older customers until my dad(in his mid 50s) called me and decided to just use our netflix account and get sling tv, that was when i realized maybe comcast is kind of screwed in the traditional cable business.
1
i dont understand why people give their money to comcast. just feeding the beast.
1
hey comcast [owns like a third of hulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hulu)
1
doesnt comcast own hulu
1
i dont have comcast but i dont like where this is headed.  can i still report them to the fcc?
1
hulu is comcast.
1
im about to move into a building that has only comcast. my boyfriend needs to watch live sports, but i have been exhisting on just netflix for 3 years via fios. how boned are we about to be?
1
can someone confirm... doesnt netflix provide nodules that take the burden of netflixs data off of comcast system?  yet, netflix data will count to this data cap?
1
this makes me so glad comcast is not available in my area.
1
not including streaming, i used 100gb in 2 days just downloading xbox one games. so glad i dont have comcast
1
i dropped comcast yesterday.  getting 1/4th the speed, but if i would have had to change my internet habits, but 25mbit is still doable
1
comcast owns hulu though....
1
1. start company2. sell company to comcast3. ????4. profit5. use profits to start new company6. sell to comcast7. rinse and repeat
1
its only a matter of time before technology makes it so no one needs comcast anymore. i already have fiber. i suspect comcast to be worth close to nothing by the end of the decade if nothing drastically changes with how they do business and treat their customers.
1
comcast owns hulu.......
1
comcast ceo: http://businessroundtable.org/about/members/brian-l-robertswhen people say "comcast" please remember where the buck ends.  in this case" your hard earned bucks".
1
comcast is mentioned 16 times on the /r/technology front page.
1
this is fucked up. people are fleeing comcast in droves because of terrible service. "vote with your wallet. thats where theyll feel it." but comcast just gouges their customers even harder as a result. after making 90% profit for 20 years, youd think theyd have enough money to afford a year in the red. no one is going to starve if comcast doesnt make its infinity billion dollars this year.
1
op focuses on the entertainment aspects of this. but because i do some media editing for work, im often passing very large files back and forth with others (and myself) via cloud storage. these caps would seriously fuck with my ability to get work done.(fortunately, i dont have comcast in my area.)
1
i feel really bad for that last grandma on comcast because she doesnt know and is set up on auto-pay.  shes going to be overdrafted by billions.
1
is comcast a publicly traded company?i blame the investors /stock holders unrealistic demands for whats happening with telco in north america."we must grow, consume, expand every quarter every year-yes yes expand!"
1
this is why i cut off my service with comcast.
1
you guys do realize that hulu is owned by comcast, right?
1
is comcast the modern aol?
1
i just dont get how comcast can be so rich and evil and still provide such terrible service.
1
as a college student, i have to respectfully disagree. 10 gb per day is the equivalent of 2 movies, or a handful of tv episodes, or (1 movie, school work, a few reddit poops, and a sports game that isnt on local tv). it adds up rather quickly. i could be wrong, but i think they got an industry average of data usage per month and used it to base the cap they set. that way, when people go over their usage, comcast can slam them with fees.
1
doesnt comcast own hulu? netflix and amazon prime is one thing, but leaving comcast for hulu isnt really sticking it to the man
1
comcasts reaponse here isnt a long term solution. this is just a way for them to grab as much money as it can while it fades away. a long term term solution would look at growing and retaining the customer base. that might mean slashing prices are getting creative and offering something new. instead it seems that comcast has accepted its ultimate fate and is making a last minute money grab.
1
i am not sure crying that comcast is evil helps. i would argue comcast does not have enough competition. if there were 10 isps in the market. i doubt comcast can get away with this "tax". cable is outmoded content distribution channel and all cable and satellite service providers have seen this coming for a decade now.
1
brian l. roberts is the ceo of comcast. instead saying comcast does this or that, simply state brian l. roberts of comcast says this or that, becauase if you going to get upset of comcast actions you might as well give credit to the ceo rather than comcast.
1
lol comcast doesnt compete with hulu. if hulu does well comcast does well
1
yea fuck comcast, soon they will learn that they will need customers.
1
why have you americans not abandoned comcast...

lol really didnt think gigabyte tax at first. i was thinking "how does comcast know about your gravity bong?"

comcast boss (ccb): guys we are losing subscribers!lowly employees (le): ikr! what do we do!ccb: heres da planle: *leans in earnestly*ccb: we charge them even more to use the service!le: *looking at each other with the i dont know about that one face*ccb: je suis le genius!le: *slowly back out of the room*

you think they will stop there?  their goal is to deliver internet like they deliver cable packages.    entertainment special - "netflix, hulu, amazon prime" - 10 a month (additional charges may be required!)  sports package - espn.com, mlb.com, nba.com - "10 a month (additional charges may be required!)  search provider - required: choose 1 search provider at 10 a month, additional search providers 5 a month    and if you think im kidding, thats already what comcast does to its cable subscribers and they make bank off that model while most of their customers likely watch less than 10% of the channels they have at all.

cant google just buy comcast and make their service not shit?
0
why cant comcast let me access xfinity on demand through my ps4? thatd be the tits
0
stop using comcast.  cancel all service or.stfu
-3
hate to tell ya, companies like netflix are wholly dependent on isps to deliver their services, so theyre essentially screwed.go ahead and bitch about it, but if comcast cant turn a profit, then their service goes bust and takes companies like netflix with it.comcast has 139,000 employees and a shit ton of infrastructure and equipment to pay for and maintain. netflix employs a whopping total of 2,000 people with some servers to maintain.
-3
i actually have free comcast tv and i havent even hooked it up. normal tv is so shitty i cant be bothered to hook it up. and by free i mean paid for in rent.
-1
so has this sub just turned into /r/comcastcirclejerk? i thought it was about technology.
-2
i hate comcast as much as anyone but why do redditors feel that unlimited data is a god given right?  other utilities like water, power, and gas are metered and the world has not stopped. i would would like to see more competition and lower rates but have no issue with metered usage.
-2
if the deal goes through, comcast will raise everyones price after making some lame excuse.if the deal does not go through, comcast will raise everyones prices out of spite.the only way customers can be treated "humanely" is for comcast to go away completely and, by law, force customers to have **choices** in which cable/internet company they wish to use.and keep pushingagain by lawfor cities to be able to do what chattanooga has done *without* interference from comcast.

if you had asked jokingly, prior to all of this, what the worst possible merger in america might be, i guarantee you a good margin of people would say "comcast and time warner".so just for fun, can anyone think of a worse possible merger than this?
28
we shouldnt even be talking about this potential merger. we should be beating the war drums for an anti-trust dissolution of comcast.

fun fact, john boehners second highest campaign contributor is comcast (50,200).  source: sunlight foundation (http://transparencydata.com/api/1.0/aggregates/pol/f990d08287c34c389cfabe3cbf3dde99/contributors.json?cycle=2014&limit=2&apikey=yourapikey)[            "employee_amount": "52600.00",        "total_amount": "57600.00",        "total_count": "56",        "name": "firstenergy corp",        "direct_count": "1",        "employee_count": "55",        "id": "567930c691434b488db60b2b6253d18f",        "direct_amount": "5000.00"    ,            "employee_amount": "45200.00",        "total_amount": "50200.00",        "total_count": "33",        "name": "comcast corp",        "direct_count": "1",        "employee_count": "32",        "id": "06d2d0dcdbda47e0bf2f37b835f6aed0",        "direct_amount": "5000.00"    ]

> during a conference call shortly after the merger announcement, a comcast executive told reporters, were certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly.sounds like a clear invocation of the sherman act to me
21
*"time warner and comcast, of course, argue that their marriage would be unambiguously pro-consumer and would generate significant cost savings and other efficiencies. but they have also effectively acknowledged that those alleged efficiencies wouldnt be passed on to consumers. during a conference call shortly after the merger announcement, a comcast executive told reporters, were certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly."*even though they will save money and be more efficient (hire less people?), they flat-out admit that none of the benefits of this will be passed along to the customers.define "pro-consumer" then... cause all im seeing is corporate gains and customer sodomy.
7
the fact that comcast is completely unapologetic for all of the bad press theyve been getting lately speaks volumes.
6
look at all the reputable publications writing about how bad comcast and twc are, and how theyd be even worse together.going to make it real weird when the merger happens anyways, isnt it?
3
i kinda wish 30 rock was still around to parody this, i love how they made fun of comcast with kabletown.
3
i feel like reddit is way too harsh on time warner cable, theyve always been great to me!   and if comcast has problems, the good folks at twc should definitely improve their service.  i know im a satisfied customer, and im just a regular internet user like each of you!
28
lets try this out...fuck comcast.
3
but how else is comcast going to end up with all of our money?
2
fuck comcast.
2
end of the article.  a comcast exec(avoidance of upper-case intended)...were certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly. increase less rapidly? **increase less rapidly**?  so in comcasts lexicon for public consumption, the concept of rapid increases is discussed.  yet the cost inherent with providing services have only incremental increases, ya know, cuz more customers. fuck, man.  im canadian and am completely happy with my internet service at 40 a month.  i feel for you fuckers.
2
to the american people:we, comcast, have more money than you.  we have more political influence.  we buy the votes and opinions we need.we will give you cable service and you will like it.  prepare to kiss our shiny metal ass.
2
im sure this wont surface from the depths of the thread, as so many comments have already been posted; but i want to offer an answer to the posts question. it seems to me that companies like comcast and twc want to always stay *just shy* of the iceberg that is the consequences of their contemptible actions. they would rather graze the berg and get by with as much power while offering as little service for as much profit as possible. so, if the merger of these two major companies were to put then at risk, they would always want the merger to be *just shy* of going through. just shy of aggravating a country into bringing them down. it might even be in their best interest to have it seem like they want to form a monopoly, and to have it fall through so that the public can shout "not that much power! not today!" followed by "weve stopped the evil!" when the deal falls apart. iceberg avoided, they stay an already powerful cartel of isps with a quieted consumer base, ready to put their weight behind other means of exploitation.
2
>can we block a merger just because the two companies involved are jerks?comcast/twc will come back with "our merger will let us improve customer service!"and since theres no real counterargument for that it will go through.
1
dont worry. when the power of comcast and time warner combine, they create dp man. now you can be fucked twice in one sitting. i dont know about yall, but that sounds like a great time saver.
1
im a small government person myself, but comcast and tw, want to have a big government that guarantees their monopoly through barriers to entry and exclusive deals **and** freedom to do whatever they want. they cant have both. pick one.
1
my question is, who is believing that this is a good deal, besides comcast-twc? what would the total market share be if this went through? surely this would approach monopoly status. edit: words
1
im hardly a comcast lover, and today i got a big runaround, mostly due to their inefficiency, but i finally got someone who was civil, nice, gave me a direct number, and was able to get me set up for what i needed.  it can happen.  that doesnt mean i support this merger, we need a lot more options, not less.
1
i looked at this post 20 minutes ago and it was voted to 4443 upvotes including my own. now its dropped to 4329....and nobody i can think of except a comcast executive would down vote it .....unless im missing something? just an interesting observation...
1
i was just talking to my hairstylist this morning and she was telling me how she just went to comcast to get a new modem. there was a huge line waiting and everyone single comcast employee left the store and the customers in line to hit up the taco truck. the they all cane back into the comcast store and went into the backroom to much leaving a huge line of people just standing there. she was shocked and most if the people just left.the sad thing is the state i am in currently is very poor and most people just take the shit...its amazing.
1
are there people that have the choice of either time warner or comcast?im not saying this isnt a bad thing (it is), but this particular reasoning doesnt really apply to me because i only have time warner where im at.  i cant threaten to switch to comcast, and ive never lived in a place that has both options.  also, i live in los angeles, so its not exactly the middle of nowhere.
1
because comcast and twc dont frequently compete as it stands, eliminating one of the telecoms doesnt dramatically change the situation. however making comcast larger would increase its bargaining power vis-a-vis content providers, potentially driving prices down.not that this will happen, just thats the upside
1
i say it is bad. the less options for someone the less likely they are to go somewhere else. hypothetically speaking,  if combat was one of 5 internet companies, and none of the other 4 could reach your area, you would be limited to comcast. therefore they can be however they want because if you need internet, they will get you. i probably worded this bad but basically less companies to choose, the more likely they are of getting you and sometimes you dont really have a choice. we have comcast, we wanted fios. we couldnt get fios, so were stuck with either comcast or some shit internet company.
1
im in eugene, oregon and when i tried to set up an account for internet with twc, they set me up with comcast. i asked why and they told me that they were already merged. is it possible its already happened?
1
but comcast says with twc theyll be "better together"! or is that a lie? /s
1
this is speculation but regarding this merger, i have a feeling that the fcc chair might be reluctant to do it. if he was trully paid off by comcast, i think it would have happened now. how old is this news?  but no. either that or his hands are tied. *like i said, i dont have all the facts so this is my gut feeling of whats happening.*
1
wait, do you guys not like comcast?
1
the massive startup costs prevent competitive entry. its just like at&t with long distance phones.  need technology to advance and eventually comcasts shitty practices will bite them in the ass...hopefully.  support innovation and use any alternative  dont support comcast and eventually theyll disappear.   and sorry to anyone with comcast as their only high speed internet provider :(
1
but fuck comcast, amirite?
1
twc is upgrading dallas to 300mb/s by the end of the year. please stay in houston comcast, shit deserves shit.
1
economies of scale.lets say you need 100 back office people to run the nations cable company. say comcast employs 75 and  twc employs another 75. theoretically, if you merged the companies you would be able to fire 50 people (synergies :d ) and pass that savings onto the customer.in practice we know that monopolies just increase prices and make more profit.
1
i have a friend who got bundled services just recently with comcast.  the bill was suppose to be about 126.00 roughly a month.  when he got the bill they charged him a failed sik fee for 50.00 dollars and a 15.00 dollar self install fee and a bunch of other bogus charges.  his actual bill was close to 300.00 dollars!  he went to the nearest comcast office and got his cable boxes and modem and installed everything himself.  but he had one cable tv box that wasnt functioning properly so he took it back to exchange for one that functioned and they charged him the failed sik fee for it.  wow, they charged him for a failed box!  they just had another price increase too this month.  he got the notice for it.  they are so expensive now that i just dont see how the average american can afford them honestly.
1
might this be good for smaller businesses? everyone hates comcast and twc... soon people will cancel those accounts and force themselves to deal with other options.
1
le comcast

welcome to reddit, here is your daily "comcast/twc/fcc is evil".edit: fcc yes, thanks /u/jeddhampton
1
so, if later down the road comcast socks away a small percentage of its oligopolistic and monopolistic plunder (including not paying the costs to society it pawns off on us via externalities) and gives this portion to charity for public relations in the billions (but theyre still a massive net drain to society overall) - will most redditors bend over backwards to kiss comcasts ass [like so many do for bill gates now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/2ewns8/how_public_relations_propaganda_can_manufacture/)just wondering...  now, go ahead, vote me down [gates groupies](http://i.imgur.com/mfdtoaq.jpg).  the public relations pay off that only a multi-billionaiire megalomaniac can afford...

its not but comcast spends a fortune on lobbying so they can make a bigger one out of their monopoly which is never going to be busted.

comcast sucks.

time for an res filter.this isnt /r/technology its /r/comcastsucks.

i say the comcast-twc merger is awesome, it wont hurt competition because they dont compete. if you dont like time warner or comcast there are always alternatives, for tv you could use bunny ears, satellite, or another provider like uverse or fios if available. for internet there are also alternatives satellite, wisps, dsl, 4g, and fiber. so there is always an alternative to comcast and time warner so why not let them merge they might actually start to care about there customers if they do

oh look its that thread of the week where you post the same shit over and over again. we get it. comcast and twc are evil.  edit: spelling.
