original source:>in an initial contract with orbital outfitters, spacex explicitly stipulated that the new spacesuits must look badass. currently, spacesuits are very far from looking badass. but some companies, like final frontier design, are off to a good start.

the 1- and 2-star ratings on glassdoor for spacex are really, really concerning. speculations of crazy work weeks and near-militant, yet cow-towing, leadership. is this true?

i visited spacex hq a few months ago and they were all talking about the space suits. i didnt get to see them, but they described them as something out of a superhero comic. skin tight, completely flexible, like the commander shepherds suit from mass effect.

spacex nor musk do not develop hyperloop. they only do a student competition in january. the whole thing is irrelevant.  **edit:** quote just as an addition  >neither spacex nor elon musk is affiliated with any hyperloop companies. while we are not developing a commercial hyperloop ourselves, we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional hyperloop prototype.  http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop

this would be lovely, except spacex makes rockets, not hyperloop.

will you be going into space? why would you quit spacex? what asteroid do you plan on mining first? what got you started into asteroid mining? how did all of you meet with the same goal?

>  we quit our jobs at jpl, intel, spacex, and jack in the box....what, exactly, did the jack in the box guy bring to the table?

hello pr, great to see you doing an ama!theres a lot of hype surrounding "new-space" at the moment, and so it is difficult to accurately gauge what is down-to-earth and what is pie-in-the-sky.i would like to ask for three very brief opinions on the prospects and timetables of:1) golden spikes plan to return humanity to the moon.2) spacexs goal of some day sending (or enabling) humans to mars.3) the economic reusability of spacexs f9r.thank you, you guys are awesome (sorry i didnt have an actual question about pr!).*ps: to the engineers who worked on mer, phoenix and msl,* **you rock!**

will you be creating your own launch systems or be contracting existing ones? (spacex, ula, etc)

a great deal of open source software is used by the alt.space industry. under the terms of the gpl, since there is no "customer", there is no need to release it, however the benefits of sharing code are well understood at this point, notably, "with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". it would be my hope that tons of duplicated effort could be reduced and problems with interoperability spotted, - and catastrophic bugs like the one that felled the falcon 1s third launch avoided - if more code related to the space program showed up in the public sphere. to what extent is planetary resources going to be releasing bits of code?are various partners (notably spacex) making code available to insure interoperability?

how did you guys all get together as a company initially (eg. quitting famed places like spacex), and venture out into the unknown territory?also...jack in the box?

im sure ill go to reddit hell for this.... but seriously? another elon musk/tesla/spacex post?hes a master marketer with a vision, no doubt, but from people in the industry hes achieved much of his success on the backs of his employees.here is a [class action lawsuit from august 2014](http://www.law360.com/articles/564591/spacex-slapped-with-wage-class-action-over-mass-layoff) for a mass layoff at spacex:>space exploration technologies corp. is facing a putative class action in california court accusing it of not properly notifying its former employees of a mass layoff of up to roughly 400 workers in the state, and not paying them wages earned before termination. the proposed class action, filed monday, alleged that spacex ordered the mass layoffs of between 200 and 400 workers on or about july 21 without giving advance notice to the them, in violation of californias worker adjustment and retraining notification act.heres a [second lawsuit filed just days later](http://www.law360.com/articles/565870/spacex-employees-file-2nd-suit-allege-unpaid-wages) alleging that spacex failed to provide employees with rest breaks or pay full wages:>the lawsuit, filed in los angeles superior court, alleges that spacex supervisors impose schedules on their employees that make it impossible for them to take statutorily required rest periods every four hours or first or second meal breaks as required by california law.and heres [the third class lawsuit by ex-employees against spacex that same month](http://www.law360.com/articles/569123/spacex-workers-launch-3rd-suit-allege-racist-policies):>space exploration technologies corp. employees on monday launched a putative class action suit in california court accusing it of fostering a racist working environment in which certain workers were subjected to slurs and passed over for promotions, making this the third employee suit to befall the rocket manufacturer in less than a month.>plaintiffs namon nolan allen and shawonna ross accused spacex of instituting policies that allowed abusive verbal behavior to persist and not allowing african-american and gay employees to be given the same terms of employment and opportunities for advancement as their colleagues.but theres more. heres one from [last year](http://www.ibtimes.com/spacex-lawsuit-alleges-elon-musks-rocket-company-forced-hourly-employees-work-clock-2151993):>a former spacex employee has filed a class action lawsuit against the rocket company, saying hourly employees are regularly expected to work overtime hours without proper compensation. its at least the fourth lawsuit alleging spacex violated california labor law to be filed since 2014.its not like you have to look very far to get these same stories. [heres a post on reddit itself](https://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/2gl2k4/nasa_to_award_contracts_to_boeing_spacex_to_fly/ckkfrmt/):>you only ever hear outside praise of spacex. as a person in the aerospace industry, i only ever hear bad stories from people who leave who worked there. they work long hours (80+ hour weeks, often), very demanding and stressful timelines, and make below industry standard pay and benefits. many people work for a few years, gain some experience, then jump ship to somewhere they can actually build a life. most of the people who stay are... enthusiastic.... to a fault.its all systemic [too](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2yo9za/til_that_during_the_first_moon_landing_the/cpbuvo6):>theyre worked into quitting. youre expected to do a lot of over time. because theres always a steady stream of equally qualified replacements. ive heard old timers (thats a relative term) even keep betting pools on how long new hires will last, and ive even had a spacex recruiter tell me at my school that people usually dont make it more than a year or two there. she even admitted she was pretty new--this was in 2010, i wonder if shes still there.you can find quotes like this all over /r/ on various subs focused on space and rocket tech. spacex and tesla have done a fantastic job marketing and getting users online to market for them. the crowd that invests in tesla, for instance, [is predominantly young](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/35058w/old_people_dont_invest_in_tesla_apple_is_middle/) and so social media and the internet - including /r/ - spreads this image of tesla, spacex, and musk. i mean seriously, just look at /r/futurology sometime and see what happens when a pro-musk post is made - straight to the top!and guess where that hyped up demographic wants to work? spacex.so what does spacex do? it works them hard, until they quit - because next year, a new crop of students will work harder for less money.and as soon as they demand higher wages or better working conditions, like those at competitors in the aerospace or auto industry, the company wont budge: theres a new and younger group that will do your job for less. so inevitably, the burnout, lack of promotion opportunities, etc. cause the turnover.rinse, wash, repeat.innovative company? hell yeah. part of the growing decline in real wages and workers working harder for less? abso-fucking-lutely.

my buddy worked for spacex. he said they worked two weeks straight without a day off, usually 12-14 hour days, which was a usual thing. all with zero compensation.  he quit after 7 months.

this man probably does push his employees very hard. when you are trying to do all the things he is trying to do you have to be very hard on people and yea you expect to put so much pressure on them that after a year or two you they are extremely burnt out.i can see how a company like his really chews through people but i think that is just the nature of the beast. applying for spacex and working there is got to be like applying for and playing in the nfl. they are only going to take the best and they are going to make you sweat blood. this is not a place you go and punch a clock at this is a place you give your life to in total dedication to for a few years then use the reference to get you some cushy job where you can relax. something like apple.

fuck spacex, they were recruiting on campus recently and i just laughed at all the clueless gomers waiting to talk to a rep.

spacex more like unpaidx! am i rite?

spacex is in bad shape. reliability of their rockets is currently far too low, and were not just talking about the falcon first stage returning home. theyve had four catastrophic losses. by way of comparison. lockheed martins family of atlas boosters has seen 97 consecutive launches without a single failure. the united launch alliance in which traditional providers lockheed martin and boeing are partnered to offer both atlas and delta launch vehicles has had 50 successful launches in a row.if spacex suffers one more catastrophic loss, their future of the company is probably going to be sunk completely. their current failure rate between falcon 1 and falcon 9 is *15%*. nobody will ever want to use them, especially for manned launches.would *you* want to ride in a vehicle that had a 15% chance of blowing up spectacularly and killing you?

so in ontario, canada, as a public accountant, i am not entitled to: - minimum wage- limits on # of hours worked- daily rest periods- time off between shifts- eating periods- overtime- public holidays- vacation with payyet, with that being the case, every single public accountant i know gets way more than that. yes, there are days when i skip lunch, or eat my desk, days where i stay until late into the night, days where i am answering emails on weekends and holidays, and is it worth it?absolutely! outside of those days, i come in early, leave early, take longer lunches, do personal tasks, watch baseball playoff streams, and much more. i assume the people working at spacex are extremely smart and talented, and choose to stay there because of the opportunities it may open in the future.

not surprising. ive heard that spacex is just a godawful place to work. the really unfortunate thing is that they really arent so different from the average american employer. im certain that most business owners would encourage pro-slavery policies. the less they need to pay their workers and afford their workers a decent standard of living, the higher their profit margins.

i worked at spacex, minimum work week was 60 hours, maximum i did was 95 hours. only got paid for 40 hours a week. i honestly loved every minute of it, cant remember a single moment i didnt have a smile on my face.

bunch of cunts! 99% of you morons complaining about long hours in a startup company like spacex are retarded and ignorant that the company is still trying to find a working business model to sell their rocket spaceship products and services! and more than likely, its not claims being pursued by spacex employees, its complaints which is not true until proven with facts, evidences, and testimonies - claims stand true until a man or woman rebut against it.also, a lot of people who complained a lot when working for apple, microsoft, google, and many startups and then left, never really believed in the mission of the company and regret leaving the vast amounts of compensation they could have been paid if they stuck around longer.
