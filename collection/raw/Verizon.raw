aol also owns the huffington post in other news, verizon is buying a rotten ham sandwich. many worry that verizons purchase will decrease the quality of the sandwich.

dear verizon. i dont want you buying old shit-tech companies, i want cheaper service.     oh, and fuck you. im leaving for t-mob when my contract is done.

ok, so i work for verizon (wireless), and while sometimes i feel like a guy in a gray suit on a star destroyer waiting for the order to blow up alderaan, i usually dont feel like i work for the bad guys -- but even when i do, its not hard for me to see that im working for the smart guys.verizon *did not* buy techcrunch and engadget -- verizon bought aol, which happens to own them and a bunch of websites that generate <10% of its operating income. most analysts expect these companies to be sold off immediately, possibly as part of the regulatory oversight of the merger that allows the deal to happen.why did verizon buy aol? because most if its growth is in *mobile advertising revenue* and it owns a ton of patents in mobile advertising. its also the third largest provider of mobile video on the web, after google and facebook.in a nutshell, verizon knows that cable tv is on the decline, and mobile viewing is on the way up. rather than being a dumb conduit for services like netflix, they want to at least be the company that owns the advertising tech, and at best be the actual video content provider (the way that, in the cable world, theyre an actual video content provider).im a consumer and a big advocate of net neutrality, and i think of this as being potentially a good thing; it means vz will have a stake in proving conclusively that it *doesnt* oppose net neutrality, and itll get ad revenue from across the globe from customers who are on other isps -- which means that itll have a vested interest in making sure that other carriers arent allowed to throttle its sites.edit: fixed a wandering grammar.

as someone who worked for aol, goodluck to verizon if they try to editorialize huffington post...their management and writers understand how valuable their brand is and they dont play nice with anyone from the business side

verizon has no interest in owning techcrunch and engadget (and you missed the big one, huffington post). they are going to spin off or sell these sites which will also make the deal more palatable for approval.http://recode.net/2015/05/12/aol-in-talks-to-spin-off-huffpost-as-part-of-acquisition-deal/

*thanks for visiting engadget, brought to you by verizon.  did you know verizon was awesome? if not, no worries we will make sure we never stop stressing it*
4
well the potentially good thing is that techcrunch wont give a shit until they all get fired for doing something verizon thinks they can stop, but techcrunch thinks is totally fine.  and then because techcrunch has a lot of assholes working there, theyll throw some shit up on other websites saying what happened, leak as much as they possibly can and whore that attention out for as much as they can before starting a new website, challenging any non-compete concepts in court after being told they couldnt perform their jobs, etc etc.or, verizon will be smart and leave them alone and let them write whatever they want because theyre profitable and it would cause a lot more legal headaches to go after the big dog in silicon valley that a whole ton of people with a whole lot of money love to use to flog their businesses.

verizon is acting just like hooli !
3
what if we (the people) crowd funded an attempt to buy up a majority of verizons shares and ran it into the ground?
4
i am sure verizon will throw its weight around to those sites with similar demands.  i wouldnt be surprised if we started seeing articles about how net neutrality is bad from them.
2
talk about a clickbait title...> it remains to be seen what  if any  changes verizon intends to make to its newly-acquired stable of online publications.right from the article. no such thing has been said to the aol ground troops id wager. aol outspent google on net neutrality last year.
2
so, verizon might censor huffington posts hard-hitting *journalism*?
2
and murdoch funds both sides of the climate change debate by owning fox news and co-owning vice media. i dont even know where to start. the problems with media are so much worse than this verizon thing and nobody cares.
2
verizon is complete shit.
2
verizon doesnt care about techcrunch and huffpost - they will sell it. heres what they want to do.[verizons acquisition of aol is a move to disrupt the tv market]( http://www.networkworld.com/article/2923020/opensource-subnet/verizons-acquisition-of-aol-is-a-move-to-disrupt-the-tv-market.html)

so verizons internet fast lane will take us back to 1990

why are they buying aol should be the question? interesting that some of the biggest news site in tech are owned by aol, and have been writing extensively about net neutrality and verizon.. hmmm i wonder if there is a connection.hopefully they will not be allowed to go ahead. cable companies should not be content provider also.. and if they are, they should be under strict regulation, ironically enough, about not regulating the content

verizon bought aol for its programmatic video ad technology, not because it wants to silence tech crunch. they might try to dissuade the staff from writing flat out anti-verizon pieces, but i highly doubt theyll make efforts to censor any net nutrality stuff, seeing as this was done pretty much because verizon wants in on the programmatic trend and is keeping most of the aol leadership anyway
2
engadgets article on the acquisition says the deal will create "the best media technology company in the world."http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/12/verizon-buys-aol/
1
irony: if verizon exercises editorial control over the media companies it owns, it may actualize its first amendment injury--and thereby increase the likelihood that courts strike down net neutrality as mandated speech.
1
verizon has realized that cable tv, sattelite tv and all that jazz is a thing of the past. jump on the bandwagon of online entertainment or youre left behind sir.
1
poor techcrunch.  first aol, now verizon.  i used to love tc...
1
ill bet item number three is you cant write anything unflattering about verizon.
1
aol also owns huffingtonpost.  aol nearly killed it verizon will finish it off.
1
thats ok. ill just ban myself from verizon-owned media properties. i already dumped their declining mobile phone service.

"man, we really lost this net neutrality battle because of these media agencies that were blasting us for our predatory practices. lets buy them and give this battle another shot".- verizon
1
am i a bad person on reddit for liking my verizon cell phone service? i mean, i do pay 150 a month for my wife and i, but i also get 12gb of data which i never come close to using.
1
this isnt about the content its about the advertising. verizon knows the user behind the phone. with aol they can now leverage that targeting info, which is typically hard as hell to acquire on a mobile user, and put that against aols inventory. profit.
1
verizon is buying aol? i guess that means my mom wont be reading about net neutrality.

[verizon chipotle exxon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfkogtgg6mo) is almost here!

not long now till this is verizons business model http://jointhefastlane.com/

wont really be an issue unless verizon hires a bunch of reporters as aol fired hundreds of us when the decided to sell controlling rights in the patch.com news platform.
1
verizon is also buying politicians but thats none of my business...
1
verizon ceo: oh yeah? well ill just buy your whole company! meh heh meh hehehehe"
1
honestly everything verizon has been doing makes me detest them... though no one else offers me the kick ass data plan, discounts, and upgrades they do. god i hate those bastards^imsorry^pleasedontmessupmyservice
1
aol also owns advertising.com, a major internet ad network.  so verizon will own a major advertising network as well.  gee, i wonder what kind of personal targeting data your isp can leverage to target ads to you.
1
just knowing that verizon now owns engadget and techcrunch skews my loyalty. at least before i didnt know who owned them and could decide for myself whether the articles were biased or not.
1
does anyone think that they will charge to use aol? i mean it is verizon. if so that will change a lot of things for aol users.
1
more unsourced allegations.  this is just speculation and rumour for clicks .  businessinsider are the same shitbags that decided to create rumours about elon musk and his attitude to child birth.   sure fuck comcast and verizon but there are also a few journalists that need the same level of recognition.,

im actually on verizon and the isps side on all this. internet access should not ever be regulated by the government.

if you want this type of "lobbying" to change, i suggest trying to write to your representatives. yes, its kind of like preaching to the choir - but if we dont even start taking small steps, congress has no pressure to change this.the easiest way to get involved is to write a personal message to your representatives. if you dont know who your representative is, you can find it here: http://whoismyrepresentative.com/____im going to try to whip up a template you guys can use to contact your politicians, but im not entirely sure how to address this issue.obviously, the ability to "buy" congress is bullshit, but how can it be changed in a way that congress might actually accept.----edit: here it is. im sorry, its pretty bad. its a sunday night and my brain doesnt seem to be in the mood to write a good message. ill try to come up with ways to improve it, but i could use some help.-----dear mr./mrs. representative,it has recently come to my attention that several large internet providers (like at&t, comcast, and verizon) are donating to incoming members of congress. i feel that this practice is detrimental to their ability to impartially represent their constituents. as im sure you can understand, allowing companies with deep pockets to donate to politicians, creates an unfair system of influence that the average american simply cannot compete with. instead of looking to help communities and humans, these donations influence politicians to focus on and address issues that benefit corporations.as your constituent, im asking that you refrain from accepting donations that may possibly influence your ability to represent me and your constituents. sincerely,me____edit 2: addressed towards some who received a donation.hi mr./mrs. new representative,i wanted to write to you to express my concern over a reason donation you have received from several corporations. it is my understanding that you have been targeted as being a new member of congress. i want to express my concern about these large donations influencing your ability to properly represent me and my fellow citizens.as you proceed in your duties, please remember that your service is not to represent special interests.i look forward to seeing you represent me and my constituents. best of luck,me

why is this even in r/technology?put it in r/muricawhine with the rest of the comcast, at&t and verizon whinepost.

7.4 mil doesnt seem very large for a company like verizon... they probably made tons more from the activity they are being penalized for.
905
verizon made [120 billion dollars](https://www.verizon.com/investor/docservlet?doc=2013_vz_annual_report.pdf) last year.the fine was 7.4 million dollars. they made up for this in **30 minutes**.selling this information netted them most likely an order of magnitude more than 7.4 million.not only does this show that being dishonest is acceptable, its actually the option that makes the most sense..
307
**coming soon to your verizon bill:**  "regulatory recovery fees".
52
what blows my mind is that verizon blatantly sold used 2 million individuals information without their consent for over 6 years, and they get slapped on the wrist with 7.4m fine. they should be fined exactly what they recognized in profits, not an arbitrary amount. not only should the be fined exactly what they made in profits illegally, they should reimburse this amount back to the 2 million people they failed to provide adequate privacy. until businesses actually get fined what they should when they exploit the very people that provide them their business, theyre going to continue to not give a damn about their customers.
69
dont make verizon pay the fcc. make verizon pay the rubes that it marketed.
22
verizons gross revenue for the past 5 years has been steadily rising from 48 billion to 60 billion... 7.4 million isnt even a drop in the bucket for them, its a single grain of rice in a all of asiaif the government can sentence a 15 year old kid to life in prison then the fcc can fine verizon at least 500 m, and considering their profits, thats still just a slap on the wristedit: their net income for the past 5 years has been 3.65b  2.55b  2.4b  875m  11.5b... wtf happened in 2014 that made them go from 875m to 11.5b
6
i have verizon.  when i got the service i got the triple play (phone, internet, and cable) because it was cheaper. within 24 hours i was getting marketing calls asking for me by name. i hadnt given out my number to anyone.  called verizon pissed for selling off my information or at the least giving it away. they denied it saying they dont do that. ever. i now keep my phone unplugged because it rings 4 to 8 times a day from solicitors.
4
shouldnt this money go to the people that verizon took advantage of?  they keep meticulous customer records - should be easy to figure out who to pay.
3
>verizon has agreed to pay a 7.4 million penalty**wrist-slap**    **wrist-slap**
3
verizon sucks a bag of dicks. no way. -.-
2
awesome so now verizon is just gonna charge me more to make up the difference...
2
i love the targeted *verizon fios* ad in the middle of the article.
2
at this point who even cares anymore?  its not like were ever going to see a cent of that money and the amount is a drop in the bucket for verizon anyway.  if anything, itll be another excuse to increase rates on its customers.  until real fines that affect their bottom line are levied against these large players, what incentives do they have to stop?
2
what i dont understand is where this revenue is going. the presumed 2 million people are the ones that deserve damages based on negligence by verizon.how does them funneling a paltry 7 million dollars to the fcc (which in turn would have the money flow to some obscure bureaucracy) accomplish anything?
2
in unrelated news verizon will be increasing customers bills
2
verizon: -throws pocket change at fcc- now go away!
2
its about time a large company like verizon gets punished for screwing over their customers. too many companies now-a-days seem immune to laws just because they have the money to throw to the right people to cover their tracks and its sick
1
"fcc fines one of the largest telecom companies in the entire world .023125% of their [2013 operating income.](http://newscenter.verizon.com/corporate/news-articles/2014/01-21-verizon-reports-2013-4q-earnings/)"or about what they make in about 2 hours.
1
my conspiracy theory. the fcc wanted to look good with the citizens and verizon wanted to pay them off for letting get away with much worse so they figured they would kill two birds with one stone.
1
so the privacy of any given verizon customer has a rough market value of 3.70. cool. i could swing that.
1
i cant figure out what exactly verizon did with the information if they didnt sell it.  everyone seems up in arms to castrate them, but as far as i can tell it was an actual mistake that didnt really lead to more revenues for verizon.
1
so why isnt this money being given to the 2 million people that verizon violated.
1
it bothers me that verizon is referred to as "it". verizon is still a company with a board of people making decisions.
1
so now taxes go down and my verizon bill doesnt go up right?
1
and now they offer the verizon rewards program.  all you have to do is sign up and every month you get free points to use toward purchasing gift certs, travel vouchers, hotel stays, etc.  and buried in the fine print is that you get these "free points" by agreeing to also enroll in verizon selects: "a program you can choose to participate in that uses information about you, including your location, web browsing and app usage data, to see whether you fit into an audience verizon or another company is trying to reach. if you choose to participate in verizon selects, you may receive marketing messages, offers and other content that interest you more than what you receive today. we wont share information that identifies you personally with any non-verizon companies."i guess if you cant illegally share peoples personal information you can always trick them into letting you do it legally.
1
ok, 2 million people had this happen, and the fine is 7.4 million, so thats 3.70 for each person. verizon likely made way more than that in doing so.
1
i love verizons quote explaining why we should not be worried:>it did not involve a data breach or an unauthorized disclosure of customer information to third parties.they mean no data breach or disclosure unauthorized by verizon - clearly this was a data breach and disclosure unauthorized by verizon customers.i wonder how they would feel if it was the customers revealing data verizon wanted private?
1
unfortunately the money verizon has to pay gets made up by increasing prices/fucking over its customers more. econ 101.
1
that money should go to the verizon customers.
1
the result of googling "verizon wireless profits" is the following:>the new york telecommunications giant reported net income attributable to verizon (which excludes the stake in verizon wireless that partner vodafone owns) of 2.23 billion, or 78 cents a share. in the year-earlier period, it posted a profit of 1.59 billion, or 56 cents a share.
1
tis all a bit of subterfuge, make verizon pay where the government knows they f-ed up; while comcast puts net-neutrality under the radar.
1
if the average 1 line on verizon is around 60 dollars... technically the 7.4 million is 120000 or so phone bills for one month... that is almost nothing for a company like verizon. they should start penalties in percentage and tiers. for example 10/20/30 percent of what you make in a year of course depending on size if crime. imo thus would be way more justice...
1
oh no! last year verizon communications took in 23.5 billion in net income. what are they going to do about this *massive* 7.5 million fine...
1
well, as a verizon customer i cant wait to pay this fine for them :/
1
are you kidding, 7.4 million is the largest fine ever levied by the fcc?? 7.4 million dollars is almost literally nothing to verizon. i wish people understood the scale of large numbers better so they wouldnt think this is a large sum.if anything, the real news is that the fine was so low, although the infraction in question is also very minor and it was verizon themselves that told the fcc about the infraction, so, fair is fair.
1
good. i recall verizon always sending me ads and shit. bank of america too.
1
edit:  verizon customers pay 7.4 million to fcc.....
1
so does that mean we hate verizon more than comcast?
1
"fcc gives verizon minor tap on the shoulder.  verizon misinterprets as pat on back... returns to business as usual."
1
i work in advertising and have used verizons data for audience targeting. its actually pretty standard but verizon should have provided an opt-out. other large companies like visa, mastercard and ebay do the exact same thing.
1
while the cost verizon got for selling this personal info is small, the cost to the people who had their personal info sold into marketing lists that will be shared for 10 years to harass, scam, and manipulate them is a thousand times greater. needs more class action lawsuit.
1
i find the title of that article to be misleading.  it makes it seem like verizon gave personal information to another party which is not true.  verizon didnt give customers the option to refuse verizon marketing for other services they offer.  its something they should be fined for but not some flagrant violation of customer privacy like the title suggests.
1
a slap on the wrist of 7m is the biggest fine ever?  time to grow a pair, fcc.  verizon will keep doing this shit if it doesnt cost them anything.
0
to be entirely fair, those two companies (& a third one) merged to become verizon. verizon didnt "buy" them, it is them.
3
coincidentally, at&t, verizon and centurylink were among the worst stocks to own in the past few years, unless you timed the bottom just right.
1
thats a little misleading, one of the baby-bells bought 3 others, then bought the old at&t.  verizon was once 3 baby bells, but sold off some of their north east operations, and later all of their wester operations, which are now largely frontier (technically now a baby-bell), and then there is century link.  so today there are at&t, inc. (which owns at&t corp.), frontier, century link, and verizon.
1
and most people dont realize that verizon is a former part of at&t. i kinda half expect them to merge back into the mothership.
1
verizon was a product of one of the bells. the only outlier was qwest, which hostilely overtook the bell serving the colorado-west region. most of century links current customer base stems from the qwest acquisition.
1
its also telling that verizon does *not* consider itself a "consumer-centric it firm."
119
verizon doesnt care about their customers. only their customers money.
154
this is blogspam; the actual article is here: [verizon exec slams google, microsoft, yahoo for nsa lawsuit grandstanding](http://www.zdnet.com/verizon-exec-slams-google-microsoft-yahoo-for-nsa-lawsuit-grandstanding-7000020769/)this is one of four versions of blogspam of this article currently on the front page of /r/politics, including two from techdirt.the actual article where all of this information comes from was by zd net, who actually did the original reporting behind this piece.  but instead of linking redditors to the actual information and rewarding investigative journalism, op and others link to the same shitty blogspam that constantly clutters this subreddit.
33
all the more reason to avoid the oligopolistic verizon and at&t

aaaaaaand goodbye verizon.

>"the laws are not set by verizon, they are set by the governments in which we operate. i think its important for us to recognise that we participate in debate, as citizens, but as a company i have obligations that i am going to follow." unless of course we can make a profit, then we abuse the courts and pay congressmen to change it to our benefit.
4
good old verizon... fucking the american people by breaking laws
13
never have i worked for a more awful company. i was unfortunate enough to get laid off and have verizon buy the contract. under their "rule" we had less employees, lower wages, no raises, increased pressure to the few that were left. they give no shits about customer satisfaction, just customer money :( on top of all this they have been in bed with the nsa the most often.i think this is what wed like to call the final nail in the coffin ^_^
3
verizon cant hear you, their ears are full of cash from their tiered data pricing.
3
gawd, at&t or verizon are the only two practical choices in my area. its like having to decide which koch brother youd rather have buggering you.
4
verizon know they control a service the public need and which side is winning
2
it sucks that verizon does this kind of thing, their coverage is truly unbeatable.
2
frankly its hardly in verizons interest to spend large amounts of money, in secret defending a lawsuit which gets them nothing.the system is broken and i have some sympathy for verizon. if google & others want to spend their profits on it, so be it. but its not actually good business sense and it wouldnt have been good pr at the time (as it couldnt have been reported).
2
every move verizon makes just proves how idiotic they are. from willingly violating its customers privacy to attempting to end net neutrality. i only hope that their deal to become independent will never bear any fruit.
2
perhaps verizon will learn something about protecting the privacy of its customers when it has none......
2
verizon is like that one kid from school who always sucked up to the teacher, and everybody hated because he/she aced all the tests and raised the bar. i hate verizon, and the only reason i use it is because most other competition is squat. and ive been on at least 3 different major vendors.
1
verizon deals with the government to keep then off their money gouging schemes. soon government will give up net neutrality as well in more secret deals.we need a lobbyist for americans...
1
at&t, verizon both were very complicit. and dont forget that many others piggyback off their service and could have been compromised under these companies watch.to the major carriers all i have to say is, fuck you.
1
welp, i definitely wont be using verizon for any of my services....ever.boycott it is.
1
fuck verizon in thier shitty, call-dropping, no signal ass. http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan

realistically, they actually *are* all grandstanding.  verizon is just calling a spade a spade.when the shit hits the fan, does anyone out there *really* think that the google, yahoo, microsoft, etc. executive team is fully willing to spend their lives in prison so the government cant snoop on their customers email?
1
just leave verizon and go to a different company.
0
whats wrong with this? why would verizon challenge it? and why wouldnt it make fun of the meaningless hand waiving by these other companies?verizons opinion is different than yours, and is consistently different. big fucking deal.
